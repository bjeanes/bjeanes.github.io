  bio: |
    Bo is a software engineer who cares deeply about simplicity in design and
    building complex behaviours out of simple primitives. Bo primarily works in
    Ruby day-to-day, though is a functional programmer at heart and a fan of
    programming languages generally, with particular soft spots for Clojure,
    Elixir, and Rust.
