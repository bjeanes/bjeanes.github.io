        <p class="f5 fw3 lh-copy mv2">Just a quick post to point out the new design for this blog. It’s nothing special — I just needed a change.

Hopefully, the change of aesthetics will motivate me to get back into blogging.

Let me know if there is any weird display issues on your browser. I only tested the latest versions of non-IE browsers, but if there are any stupid obvious fixes to any browser, I’ll implement them.

Tell me what you think, keeping in mind I’m a developer not a designer :P.

        <h3 class="f3 fw6 lh-title mb0">Hell yes</h3>
        <p class="f5 fw3 lh-copy mv2">Although long overdue, I’m here to tell you why I joined Obtiva and why
I think you should too.

About 10 months ago, I found myself looking for a job. I had plenty of
freelance work and plenty of time to find the right fit for myself. With
this in mind, I decided to adopt a new philosophy to apply in situations
like this.

I realised that you don’t always get the full potential out of life
until you <strong>face up to what you really want</strong> out of it.

The core principle of this outlook was inspired by reading <a href="http://sivers.org/hellyeah">a fantastic
blog post</a> that had one message: If you
can’t say “HELL YEAH!” to something, just say “No” instead.

This message resonated with me and helped me considerably to get what I
really wanted out of the next few months. I knew that what I really
wanted more than anything was to work with incredible people who
inspired and challenged me on a daily basis. I knew then and still do
now that if this basic need wasn’t met, I’d be looking for a new job
within a few months.

I knew that to make the best of my time, I had to take my time. I put
the word out to the world (via a <a href="http://bjeanes.com/2010/08/19/my-future">blog
post</a>) stating what I wanted
and began networking and contacting companies I thought I’d like.

One of the first things I did when I got on the phone with any potential
employer was to tell them that I would not be accepting any jobs
immediately. I wanted to take at least a few months to get a good feel
for the work places and the people of which they were comprised.

I was contacted by nine fantastic opportunities across the world. They
included opportunities in Sweden, Spain, Mexico, the USA, Canada, and my
home, Australia.

With each opportunity, I stated that I wanted to come to their office
(anywhere in the world) and spend a week working with the people who
would become my coworkers and on the projects that I would be a part of.

After several experiences at different locations, I had the pleasure of
spending a week in Chicago with the Obtivians. Finally, this was a place
I knew I wanted to work at. Obtiva has some of the most amazing people
I’ve had the pleasure of getting to know. Each of them is smart,
passionate, interesting, modest, and inspiring. I knew I could only come
out the other end of working with them a better developer and human
being than before.

Several of my visits with offices prior to Obtiva felt like interesting
and challenging places to work at, but none of them gave me an
overwhelming sensation of happiness and excitement as Obtiva did and
still does.

Ultimately, I don’t plan on being a consultant for most of my career,
but I know that as long as I am one, I want to be one with these guys.

So, face up to what you want. Say no until you are moved to say yes as
though by an external force (other than
coercion!). There’s no room for compromising on happiness, fulfillment, and personal growth.

Also, Obtiva kicks ass. If you are a passionate developer or have an interesting project, drop us a line, and let us move you to say “HELL YES!”
