Just a quick post to point out the new design for this blog. It's nothing special — I just needed a change.

Hopefully, the change of aesthetics will motivate me to get back into blogging.

Let me know if there is any weird display issues on your browser. I only tested the latest versions of non-IE browsers, but if there are any stupid obvious fixes to any browser, I'll implement them.

Tell me what you think, keeping in mind I'm a developer not a designer :P.
