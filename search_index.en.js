For example, good data allows\ndevelopers to check that new features behave as expected with real-world data,\nthat a bugfix actually fixes a bug for a known scenario, or to benchmark a\ndatabase migration or the performance of new code.\nLike many technology companies, at Covidence we\nuse staging environment in a number of these critical ways, and more. In fact,\nwe actually use several different staging environments, some persistent and\nsome temporary.\n\nProduction Deployments\nIn production, we run two main deployments: production and demo. Our\nproduction environment is... just that. Our demo environment is version of\nour application that acts as a kind of playground for potential customers to\nevaluate our product or for existing customers to learn or experiment with the\nproduct without risking their production data. Data in this environment is\nexpunged on a rolling basis.\nNon-production Deployments\nIn staging, we have one environment each to mirror the production versions:\nstaging and demo-staging. These two deployments automatically get the\nlatest version of the code that has passed our continuous integration test\nsuite. The expectation is that these environments should be reasonably stable\nand relatively safe to deploy to the production environments.\nAdditionally, we have a dev environment which deploys the latest code,\nregardless of build status. This environment is expected to be less stable and\nis sometimes used to deploy feature branches that need to see production\nquality data before it can be merged to master. This also tends to be the\nenvironment in which migrations are tested and benchmarked.\nLastly, we use an excellent feature of Heroku Pipelines to create disposable\nstaging apps for any open pull request to allow us to sanity check and QA test\nthe change.\nData\nOf all those environments, only the pull request apps have \"seed\" data.\nstaging, demo-staging, and dev always have a recent snapshot of\nproduction data to work with.\nKeeping fresh production quality data in staging environments is a really\ncommon problem for many companies and can often go along time without a\nsolution. However, we knew that it was an important problem to solve if we were\nto work efficiently and effectively with our small team.\nI want to share how we leverage some handy features of Heroku\nPostgres to have effortless, push-button\nproduction quality data in these staging environments.\nScheduled and push-button database forks\nBasically, we use Heroku's database \"forking\" functionality, environment\nvariable-based configuration and database promotion, the Heroku Toolbelt, and a\nfew Heroku API calls to orchestrate a replacement DB.\nWe wrap up these steps in a script which runs every Sunday night via a\nscheduled Buildkite job or whenever we push the \"Build\" button manually. This\nmeans that our staging environment is never stale by more than about a week.\nThe steps to do this for each app are:\n\nCreate a new database as a --fast --fork of the production database, which\nwill use a compination of Postgres Write-Ahead Logs and leader-follower\nreplication to relatively quickly prepare a new database as a replica and\nonce it has caught up to the primary database, will separate from it as a\nstandalone instance.\nKeep track of the name of the old DB and the new DB.\nWhen the replica is fully prepared and ready to process queries, promote it\nvia environment variables on and a restart of the application.\nDe-provision the old database so we aren't paying for it.\n\nFor our demo to demo-staging copy, the dataset is actually so small that we\nare using cheaper plans which don't support Heroku's forking, so for that we do\nsomething slightly different:\n\nCreate new database\nInitiate a copy of data from the production version to staging version\n(essentially a dump and then restore)\nOnce complete, promote new database and de-provision old one, as above.\n\nCode\nHere's the actual script we use, more-or-less un-changed:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nset -ex\n\n# Pass in Heroku API token\ntoken=$1\n\n# We run this script in a stateless Docker image, so to make the script a bit\n# cleaner, we just write out the credentials to a file that the Heroku Toolbelt\n# knows to read.\nif ! grep -lq api.heroku.com ~/.netrc 2&gt;/dev/null; then\n  echo \"machine api.heroku.com\" &gt; ~/.netrc\n  echo \"  login dev+heroku@covidence.org\" &gt;&gt; ~/.netrc\n  echo \"  password $token\" &gt;&gt; ~/.netrc\n\n  chmod 0600 ~/.netrc\nfi\n\n# Helper function for calling Heroku API\nfunction hapi {\n  curl \\\n    --fail \\\n    --silent \\\n    --netrc \\\n    --header 'Accept: application/vnd.heroku+json; version=3' \\\n    https://api.heroku.com$*\n}\n\n# Routine to wait for DB to be caught up, then promote it and de-provision the\n# old instance.\nfunction promote {\n  app=$1\n\n  heroku pg:wait --wait-interval 10 -a $app\n  heroku pg:unfollow -a $app --confirm $app $app::NEW_DATABASE || true\n  heroku addons:attach -a $app $app::DATABASE --as OLD_DATABASE\n  heroku pg:promote -a $app NEW_DATABASE\n  heroku addons:detach -a $app NEW_DATABASE\n  heroku addons:destroy -a $app --confirm $app OLD_DATABASE\n  heroku run:detached -a $app rails runner 'Ops::Staging::Search.massacre!'\n}\n\n# Routine to create a new DB with a deterministic name so that we can more\n# easily promote it later.\n#\n# There is also some logic here to recover from a build which got interrupted\n# mid-way so that we don't accumulate orphaned DBs that we have to pay for.\nfunction create {\n  app=$1\n  plan=$2\n\n  shift 2\n\n  existing=$(hapi /addons/$app::DATABASE | jq -Mr .name)\n  new=$(hapi /addons/$app::NEW_DATABASE | jq -Mr .name || true)\n\n  if [ -z \"$new\" ]; then\n    heroku addons:create \\\n      -a $app heroku-postgresql:$plan \\\n      --as NEW_DATABASE \\\n      $*\n  else\n    if [ \"$new\" == \"$existing\" ]; then\n      heroku addons:detach -a $app NEW_DATABASE\n      create $app $plan\n    else\n      true # already got a new one in waiting\n    fi\n  fi\n}\n\n# Takes a snapshot and copies it.

This is what it looks like:\n\nI was instantly intrigued and was drawn to a few key features:\n\nEasy to learn\nCaps lock is replaced with backspace (making backspace closer to\nfingers and getting rid of the useless caps lock)\nObvious health benefits (just look how much your fingers need to\nmove when using QWERTY here)\nIt’s not QWERTY, which was designed without any consideration to\nergonomic or efficiency\naspects.\n\nLong story short: it took me a few tries to commit to learning it (3\ntries over year in fact). Eventually I went cold turkey for a week and\nhaven’t looked back. Typing is more comfortable and faster already.\nGetting Colemak on OS X is as simple as following the simple\nInstallation instructions. The instructions\nseem out of date when it comes to re-mapping caps lock to backspace. It\nis as simple as downloading\nPCKeyboardHack,\ninstalling it, rebooting, and choosing the option in its preference pane\nto remap caps lock to delete (key code 51).\nSnow Leopard\nColemak itself works fine under Snow Leopard, however the PCKeyboardHack\nutility does not work, because it is hardcoded to only load the kernel\ndriver if it recognises the OS version. Luckily it is open source, and I\nwas able to import the Mercurial project into a\nGitHub\nproject, modify it, and\nbuild a version that works fine on Snow Leopard.\nDead Keys that Apple uses on the QWERTY layout\nOne thing I loved about the QWERTY layout on OS X was the sensible dead\nkey and alternate character behaviours, allowing users to quickly and\nlogically input characters such as: , é, ¡, ¿, », ‡, °, etc. The\nversion of Colemak, for one reason or another, moved or simply didn’t\nhave many of these shortcuts.\nSo, I created my own Colemak layout bundle that moves the dead key\npositions to preserve the associations with the character position\nchanges from QWERTY to Colemak. This means, for example,  can be\ncreated by pressing ⌥⇧K on either keyboard layout (where K is the key\nthat outputs K, not the key that physically says K on it).\nMy version of the Colemak bundle is available on my\nGitHub and a direct download to a\nzip file is available\nhere.\nSimply put the .bundle file in your ~/Library/Keyboard Layouts\ndirectory.

This is achieved without resorting to\nmoving files around a working directory and staging dirty changes away safely,\nby leveraging some neat internals of Git.\nWhy?\nBut first, why would someone want to do this?\nIn general, storing (deterministically) buildable artifacts in a repository can\nbe unneccessary and even problematic. For example: building a binary which\ncan't run on all platforms that might use the repository; or creating large\nfiles which grow the repository size rapidly (e.g. JARs).\nIn the past, I have been in situations where using Git's object model to store\nan immutable history of changes in compiled outputs has been useful, in\nparticular for analytical purposes.\nHowever, this time, the reason is rather mundane: GitHub's Jekyll compilation\nwhitelists certain plugins (for good, security-related reasons) and I had set\nup this blog using a theme and plugin combination that apparently is not\ncompatible with GitHub-built Jekyll projects.\nHow\nGitHub expects to find source files for GitHub Pages deployment in either the\ngh-pages or main branch (depending on whether its building a project page\nor a user/org page). All that was necessary was to generate the compiled files\ninto that appropriate branch.\nHowever, I did not want it to be up to the person making changes to the blog to\nhave to remember to generate and commit the generated files. In addition, it was\nimportant to me that the Git history of source changes was not conflated with\nthe adjacent need to store the compiled version.\nThat meant:\n\nAs much automated as possible\nThe compiled branch (main, in this case) should be nothing but the\ngenerated files and a separate commit history.\n\nUnderstanding git commit\nWhen you run a command like git commit ., Git is doing a few of things\nof interest internally:\n\ngit-write-tree stores the current state of your (staged) files as a tree\ngit-commit-tree creates a commit for that tree (and, usually, a parent\ncommit)\ngit-update-ref Updating a ref (branch) to point to that new commit\n\nBy dropping down a level and taking control of these primitives directly, we\ncan actually exercise a little bit more control over what is in the commit and\nhow that commit relates to the rest of the repository's history.\nWriting a tree at a custom root\nThe key ingredient that we will leverage is the --prefix flag to\ngit-write-tree. This allows us to create a tree object rooted at an arbitrary\ndirectory!\nFor example, compare the following:\n$ git show $(git write-tree)\ntree c97ce6b80599da62e34a684a245dec5df1228b8d\n\n.buildkite/\n.gitignore\nCNAME\nGemfile\nGemfile.lock\n_config.yml\n_data/\n_drafts/\nassets/\nbin/\nindex.html\npages/\n\n$ git show $(git write-tree --prefix pages)\ntree 8e479816fadad469d16bcb16c24413feb780765f\n\narchive.html\ncategory.html\ntag.html\n\nPiecing it together\nThe main caveat to account for is that git-write-tree will only write staged\nor committed files. I don't want to keep the built files in the source branch\nso I have the build directory ignored, which means those files are neither\ncommitted nor staged.\nTo work around this, a bin/deploy script temporarily stages the files for the\nduration of the commit building. NOTE, because I am deploying to main\nbranch, I configured the repository's default branch to be source and the\nbin/deploy script lived there, along with all the Jekyll source files.\nHere's a simplified version of the script:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nbranch=\"main\"\nbuild_dir=\"dist\"\n\n# This can be substituted for any command which builds artifacts to a\n# specific directory\nbundle exec jekyll build --destination $build_dir\n\n# Force the files to be added, regardless of .gitignore\ngit add -f $build_dir\n\n# Write tree to an object\ntree=$(git write-tree --prefix=$build_dir)\n\n# Un-stage the build so it is back to being ignored\ngit reset -- $build_dir\n\n# Create a new commit for that tree as a child of target branch's commit\ncommit=$(git commit-tree -p $branch -m \"Deploy\" $tree)\n\n# Update the GitHub Pages' branch to the new commit\ngit update-ref refs/heads/$branch $commit\n\n# Push the compiled branch to GitHub\ngit push origin $branch\n\nAutomated builds\nI used our existing Buildkite CI setup to quickly add\na build which essentially just called bin/deploy to automatically deploy\nchanges we made to GitHub (much the way that GitHub would automatically deploy\nchanges if I were committing directly to main/gh-pages).\nSome changes for resilience\n\n\nI wanted to preserve committer/authorship metadata for the deploy commits to\nmake it clear whose latest change is deployed. To handle this, the\nbin/deploy script takes these details from the commit being built and sets\nsome env vars before we generate the deploy commit:\nexport GIT_AUTHOR_NAME=$(git show -s --format='%an' HEAD)\nexport GIT_COMMITTER_NAME=\"$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME\"\nexport GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL=$(git show -s --format='%ae' HEAD)\nexport GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL=\"$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL\"\n\ncommit=$(git commit-tree -p $branch -m \"Deploy\" $tree)\n\n\n\nI wanted to make it clear which commit had been deployed, so I augmented the\ncommit creation step to record a description of the source commit in the commit\nmessage, including whether or not the working directory had uncommitted\nchanges:\nidentifier=$(git describe --dirty --always) # e.g. \"213c9af\", \"213c9a-dirty\"\ncommit=$(git commit-tree -p $branch -m \"Deploy $identifier\" $tree)\n\n\n\nFor maximum re-usability, I have the script detect the target branch based on\nthe type of repository (project or user/org):\n# Determine which branch GitHub pages is built from, for this repository\nremote=$(git config remote.origin.url)\nif [[ $remote = *.github.io ]] || [[ $remote = *.github.io.git ]]; then\n  branch=main\nelse\n  branch=gh-pages\nfi\n\n\n\nTo still work in CI where a clean checkout has occurred without necessarily\ncreating local branch refs, I use long-form names\n(refs/remotes/origin/$branch or refs/heads/$branch, as appropriate)\n\n\nResult\nFeel free to have a look at the repository for the\nblog. The main branch\ncontains the history of deployed changes and the source branch contains the\nhistory of source changes.\nThis blog post was deployed in this manner.\n\nRelated gist\n","id":"https://bjeanes.com/posts/deploy-directory-to-branch/","title":"Deploy a sub-directory as a branch"},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/factories-breed-complexity/":{"body":"Having maintainable code is great. Maintainable code allows you to deliver improvements faster, happier, and more reliably. \nFurthermore, the measures that developers need to take and the strategies that we have to employ to achieve maintainable code have been understood for years, if not decades. Especially in the realm of object-oriented programming, but certainly not exclusively, most of these principles boil down to reducing coupling and system complexity. A system whose parts are coupled as loosely as possible is a modular system; the parts know little of each other and a lot about themselves and they have thin and specific interfaces between each other.\nTest-driven development is one of the many tools at a developer's disposal to achieve code quality. Unfortunately, there is a lot of naïveté around the benefits of TDD. A lot of developers see TDD as primarily a tool for verifying system correctness. While TDD does of course offer this benefit, and arguably better than retroactive automated testing, the real benefit of TDD is that it offers short feedback loops that guide the design/architecture of the system.\nSince it is accepted that a loosely-coupled modular system is a simpler system, it stands that tools, such as TDD, which guide a design towards modularity and simplicity are good tools. A module that is tightly coupled to another is not easily tested in isolation. However, if the isolated tests are written first, it is difficult to write a passing implementation for that module that maintains such a low degree of coupling. Therefore, good TDD should guide you towards a simpler design (though it is certainly not the only way).\nUnfortunately, factories work against this goal. Factories debilitate TDD's ability to give you feedback into the complexity of your design.\nTo be clear, I am not talking about the Factory Method Pattern\nor the Abstract Factory Pattern — both of which can be described\nas ways to decouple a particular implementation\nof an object from code for the creation of such an object (Wikipedia). Instead, I am talking about the \"factories\" for replacing fixtures in tests —&nbsp;something which has seemingly obsessed the Ruby (Rails, especially) community. The two primary Ruby libraries for factory-based fixture replacement are factory_girl and Machinist.\nA tool such as Machinist or factory_girl generates data for the attributes you don't care about, and constructs any necessary associated objects, leaving you to specify only the fields you care about in your test (from Machinist's own README file). This sounds nice at first, because it makes your tests more readable and relevant. However, behind the scenes, these tools are still creating other objects and entities and introducing them into your test environment. By having data and objects in tests that are irrelevant to the functionality that is being tested (in isolation, remember), a developer creates an environment that permits, if not invites, silent dependencies to creep into an implementation.\nFurthermore, and perhaps more significantly, by creating objects (and usually entire hierarchies of objects) with such ease and opacity, you are outright masking the dependencies (*cough* complexity *cough* coupling) between your implementation and those entities. If forced to stub out all those intricacies, the system complexity would be screamingly obvious and a developer would quickly avail herself of a rewrite to reduce complexity or thin out the interface. \nInstead of having feedback that guides a developer to simplicity, fixture factories seem to guide developers to complexity by masking dependencies as one-line simplicity. In fact, that one (or five, whatever) line setup is a shotgun blast of environmental dependencies that are hidden from the architect. That complexity will come back for revenge after being ignored for so long.\nIt seems that factory_girl and Machinist exist to make testing components more convenient. This is, at face value, an admirable and desirable goal. However, in unit tests, the cost is too high for any system of considerable size. \nPlease, do the right thing and avoid the convenience and \"fun\" of the factory_girl temptress. You will trend towards a simpler system and as a bonus (in fact, an incredible one) your test suite will likely be exponentially faster which, in turn, will breed simplicity by letting you have more feedback more often.\nP.S. It shouldn't go without mention that factories can be absolutely awesome for integration tests. Integration tests aren't used for guiding system design nor testing in isolation so the drawbacks of these tools drop away. However, both factory_girl and Machinist use RSpec as some of their very first usage examples and this troubles me deeply.\nP.P.S. A lot of these arguments can be applied to fixtures too. However, they usually don't create hordes of objects invisibly and litter your environment with them. Also, they aren't as slow. But yes, the fewer factories and fixtures in a test, the better.\nUpdate for clarity: Firstly, I am absolutely just talking about unit tests. If you are testing code that integrates with ActiveRecord or number of levels of your stack, then factories and fixtures are certainly defensible (though I still prefer to steer clear). Secondly, I've tried to be careful about where I use the words simple, easy, complex, and difficult. For the definitions that I intend, please watch (at least the first 10 minutes of) Simple Made Easy. \n","id":"https://bjeanes.com/posts/factories-breed-complexity/","title":"Factories breed complexity"},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/fish-shell-version-of-git-ps1-function-that-is-bundled-with-git/":{"body":"Today at ActionHack, I was showing off Fish Shell to\n\"`geoffreyd\":http://twitter.com/geoffreyd.

A few days later, I came back\nto this code to finish it and realised that something was awry with the\nvalues I was getting out of the Hash. It took me a while to figure it\nout because the values were all integers being summed together and I was\nnever looking or setting the values directly.\nHowever, eventually I saw a pattern — many of the values were the same.\nFor instance, given the following assignments, I should expect\n[ruby]p entries[153][:monday] #=&gt; [12.hours]:\nentries[153][:monday]  &lt;&lt; 12.hours\nentries[153][:tuesday] &lt;&lt; 3.hours\nentries[87][:monday]   &lt;&lt; 7.hours\nentries[87][:tuesday]  &lt;&lt; 2.5.hours\n\nHowever, what I found was the following:\np entries[153][:monday]  #=&gt; [12.hours, 3.hours, 7.hours, 2.5.hours]\np entries[153][:tuesday] #=&gt; [12.hours, 3.hours, 7.hours, 2.5.hours]\np entries[87][:monday]   #=&gt; [12.hours, 3.hours, 7.hours, 2.5.hours]\np entries[87][:tuesday]  #=&gt; [12.hours, 3.hours, 7.hours, 2.5.hours]\n\n# And in fact:\np entries[:any][:thing]  #=&gt; [12.hours, 3.hours, 7.hours, 2.5.hours]\n\nLet that soak in for a second. Hash.new({}) uses the same\ninstance of the internal Array as the default value for each\nof the inner-most keys. It also doesn’t set the key you want so\np entries still printed {}. In retrospect, it is\nblatantly obvious that it does this, but the ramifications are still\nhuge.\nThe way to get the intended effect is of course to use the block syntax\nof [ruby]Hash.new which, while much uglier, definitely works as\nexpected:\nentries = Hash.new {|hash, key| hash[key] = Hash.new {|h, k| h[k] = [] }}\nentries[153][:monday]  &lt;&lt; 12.hours\nentries[153][:tuesday] &lt;&lt; 3.hours\nentries[87][:monday]   &lt;&lt; 7.hours\nentries[87][:tuesday]  &lt;&lt; 2.5.hours\n\np entries #=&gt; {87=&gt;{:monday=&gt;[7.hours], :tuesday=&gt;[2.5.hours]}, 153=&gt;{:monday=&gt;[12.hours], :tuesday=&gt;[3.hours]}}\n\nWow.

My values have changed and it’s affected the way I think and work.\nThere has been a gradual progression towards caring more and more about the Right Way™ to do things. For example, more than ever before, I value simplicity and clarity over ease and cleverness (an epidemic that greatly afflicts the Ruby community, in my opinion).\nBut, these values have come at a cost to me. Somewhere along the way, I complacently let getting it right become far more important than getting it done.” Don’t get me wrong, getting things right is very important — where I went wrong was valuing getting it right the first time. \nIt may not plague others to the extent that it has me, but this misplaced obsession has gotten in the way of progress.

I had plenty of\nfreelance work and plenty of time to find the right fit for myself. With\nthis in mind, I decided to adopt a new philosophy to apply in situations\nlike this.\nI realised that you don’t always get the full potential out of life\nuntil you face up to what you really want out of it.\nThe core principle of this outlook was inspired by reading a fantastic\nblog post that had one message: If you\ncan’t say “HELL YEAH!” to something, just say “No” instead.\nThis message resonated with me and helped me considerably to get what I\nreally wanted out of the next few months. I knew that what I really\nwanted more than anything was to work with incredible people who\ninspired and challenged me on a daily basis. I knew then and still do\nnow that if this basic need wasn’t met, I’d be looking for a new job\nwithin a few months.\nI knew that to make the best of my time, I had to take my time. I put\nthe word out to the world (via a blog\npost) stating what I wanted\nand began networking and contacting companies I thought I’d like.\nOne of the first things I did when I got on the phone with any potential\nemployer was to tell them that I would not be accepting any jobs\nimmediately. I wanted to take at least a few months to get a good feel\nfor the work places and the people of which they were comprised.\nI was contacted by nine fantastic opportunities across the world. They\nincluded opportunities in Sweden, Spain, Mexico, the USA, Canada, and my\nhome, Australia.\nWith each opportunity, I stated that I wanted to come to their office\n(anywhere in the world) and spend a week working with the people who\nwould become my coworkers and on the projects that I would be a part of.\nAfter several experiences at different locations, I had the pleasure of\nspending a week in Chicago with the Obtivians. Finally, this was a place\nI knew I wanted to work at. Obtiva has some of the most amazing people\nI’ve had the pleasure of getting to know. Each of them is smart,\npassionate, interesting, modest, and inspiring. I knew I could only come\nout the other end of working with them a better developer and human\nbeing than before.\nSeveral of my visits with offices prior to Obtiva felt like interesting\nand challenging places to work at, but none of them gave me an\noverwhelming sensation of happiness and excitement as Obtiva did and\nstill does.\nUltimately, I don’t plan on being a consultant for most of my career,\nbut I know that as long as I am one, I want to be one with these guys.\nSo, face up to what you want. Say no until you are moved to say yes as\nthough by an external force (other than\ncoercion!). There's no room for compromising on happiness, fulfillment, and personal growth.\nAlso, Obtiva kicks ass.

There is such a raw and incomparable power that you get when making things with code and with perfectly suited software tools.\nMakers\nA master cabinet maker can build the most ornate and beautiful cabinet with the simplest tools but it takes a long time and mistakes are costly. When mistakes are costly and the creative process is extensive, the cabinet maker's ability to experiment and grow is hindered, and the quality can suffer as a result. With better tools, (s)he can be more productive, experiment with new designs through prototyping, and improve their craft.\nMaking for Makers\nI am a tool maker.\nI've known this for some time now. My deepest satisfaction in my work has come from making someone else's job easier, more productive, and, most importantly, more enjoyable.\nThe master cabinet maker is arguably adding value to the world, no matter their productivity. However, as a tool maker, one has the ability to have a multiplicative effect on the world. By making tools for other makers the effect is arguably exponential.\nI want to help all makers experiment, grow, and, ultimately, make the world better.\nBuilding great tools is quickly becoming my guiding principle. I plan to do this by remembering that feedback is the most valuable skill to learning, growing, and making and incorporating this concept into the tools that I build. Great tools provide actionable and specific feedback quickly and directly.\nHeroku Makes for Makers\nNext Monday will be my first day at Heroku. I've used Heroku in some form or another since it was an online code editor for Rails. \nThe moment I knew I was going to join Heroku was when I was allowed to sit in on one of their all hands, where I heard Oren Teich talk about Heroku's guiding principle. More or less, he articulated my own guiding principle of helping makers.\nI couldn't be more excited to start.\n","id":"https://bjeanes.com/posts/makers-and-making/","title":"Makers & Making"},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/motivate-your-lazy-sequences/":{"body":"I love Clojure’s laziness.\nRecently, I’ve been using lazy-seq  to consume remote collections via APIs, fetching pages of data transparently and only as needed. Gary Fredericks, Mike Busch, and I applied this to a project of ours that had to crunch tens of thousands of records from Salesforce. I’m also doing something similar with a personal project that has to fetch a lot of Pivotal Tracker stories to reduce them.\nIn cases like these, consuming (potentially unbounded) resources in a lazy manner allows one to start processing data earlier and to make as few requests as possible to get only the data you need.\nMostly Lazy\nI want to talk about a neat little thing I did in my project to get a nice little performance boost on top of this laziness, without having to think about any low-level concurrency concerns.\nLaziness\nHere’s a piece of code that provides an “infinite” lazy sequence. In this case, it is of tweets:\n(require '[clj-http.client :as http])\n\n(defn tweets-for\n  ([user] (tweets-for user nil))\n  ([user last-tweet-id]\n     (lazy-seq\n      (let [url \"http://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/user_timeline.json\"\n            params {:limit 10 :screen_name user}\n            params (if last-tweet-id (assoc params :max_id last-tweet-id) params)\n            response (http/get url {:query-params params :as :json})\n            tweets (:body response)]\n\n        (when (not-empty tweets)\n          (concat tweets\n                  (tweets-for user (:id (last tweets)))))))))\n\nSo that’s cool. Now, note the following performance characteristics when contemplating the next section:\n(def my-tweets (tweets-for \"bjeanes\"))\n\n;; The following returns after a delay while we fetch the first page:\n(first my-tweets) ;=&gt; {:text \"Tweet 0\" ...}\n\n;; This returns instantly because our `tweets-for` function fetches 10 tweets per page:\n(nth my-tweets 9) ;=&gt; {:text \"Tweet 9\" ...}\n\n;; This returns after a delay because this tweet is on the next (still lazily unfetched) page:\n(nth my-tweets 10) ;=&gt; {:text \"Tweet 10\" ...}\n\nMotivation\nSo laziness is pretty cool. But, sometimes, things can improve if you are ever so slightly less lazy. What if we could remove that little pause between the 9th and the 10th items in the list where we are just waiting around for the network request to Twitter to complete? We could be using our time to do more CPU-melting tweet crunching! Well, it turns out we can easily do it.\nAssume for a moment that we have some calculation (process) that takes a considerable amount of CPU time to process:\n(defn process\n  \"Do some really hard work with our tweets\"\n  [tweets]\n  (map #(Thread/sleep 100) tweets))\n\nIf we know we will be consuming a substantial amount of the lazy sequence, we could encourage the sequence to go ahead and start realizing the next chunk of our sequence.\nThis would mean that instead of processing 10 tweets, waiting, processing 10 tweets, waiting, etc.:\n\n... we would be able to process tweets continuously back-to-back:\n\nWouldn't also be great if we didn't have to think about the parallelism at all? To this end, I present motivate:\n(defn motivate\n  \"Motivate a lazy sequence to seek slightly ahead of the sequence consumer's position.\"\n  ([coll] (motivate coll 1))\n  ([coll motivation]\n     (lazy-seq\n      (future (nth coll motivation))\n      (cons (first coll) (motivate (rest coll) motivation)))))\n\nLet’s compare:\n(time (process (take 100 (tweets-for \"riblah\"))))\n;=&gt; “Elapsed time: 11545.011 msecs\"\n(time (process (take 100 (motivate (tweets-for \"riblah\") 5))))\n;=&gt; \"Elapsed time: 10394.769 msecs\"\n\nThe speed difference is noticeable even when processing only a 100 tweets. If we were doing more than 100 milliseconds/tweet of processing, fetching a lot more data, or dealing with a slow upstream dependency, the speed improvements would be even clearer.\nThe last (optional) parameter to motivate is the “motivation factor”. If your CPU-bound work is long-running, this number can be smaller without a noticeable difference. The ideal number depends on how long each IO operation takes and much processing you do with each chunk.\nEssentially, the motivation you give to the lazy sequence is a trade-off between waiting for IO and wasting IO; that is, the lower the number, the more likely you are to wait on IO but the higher the number, the more IO you’ll perform unnecessarily (at least, if you aren’t guaranteed to consume the whole sequence.\nHopefully this is handy to someone else out there. I wouldn’t at all be surprised if something like this already existed (UPDATE Yup: seque) or if this completely obvious to seasoned Clojurian, but it was a pleasant moment discovering this possibility on my own.\n","id":"https://bjeanes.com/posts/motivate-your-lazy-sequences/","title":"Motivate your lazy sequences"},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/my-future/":{"body":"Mocra\nTwo weeks ago, Dr Nic informed me, and my coworkers, that he had\naccepted a job with\nEngineYard and\nwas moving to San Francisco within the month.

I take that back — I love modal editing. \nActually, I think very few people like Vim, it just happens to be the best kid on the block at modal editing. But, after using Vim (and, God, does it take a while to learn to use it), you are reduced to a pathetic teary wreck every time [you] have to use a text editor that isn't vim.\nAnd why is it so debilitating to use something other than Vim for those who have honed their modal editing skills? Frankly, magic sauce of Vim is (mostly) made up from a few quite simple ingredients: motions, text objects, operators. There are plenty of cool tricks hidden inside Vim, but those three main things are the things you really miss, consistently, when using something else.\nEvery now and then, when forced outside of the comforting (yet somehow cold) embrace of Vim, the Vimmer flirts with Sublime Text 2’s vintage mode or IdeaVIM. We may even be impressed — but, eventually, something falls apart and the abstraction leaks.\nUsually, this failure happens because the Vi(m) emulation layer often doesn’t implement motions, text objects, and operators. They just implement some keystrokes that appear to do the same thing in the same way —&nbsp;until you try something the developer didn’t preempt.\nIf I could have an editor that did these things properly, I would have no real attachment to Vim. I have other things about Vim that I love and would hate to lose but they aren’t unique and other editors (can) have them, too.\nLuckily for me, I’ve been doing too much Clojure to ignore Emacs forever and 2 weeks ago, I switched. Here's how it played out:\n\nNope —&nbsp;not for me... But, wait! Let us try this Evil Mode so we can mock their pitiful attempt at modal editing (*evil laugh here*).  What’s this‽ It’s actually good!\n\nInner dialogs aside, I’m not kidding; Evil Mode is stunning. It doesn’t have everything —&nbsp;but everything that it does have is built up using the same functions macros that you can use to extend it. Those are: (evil-define-state) (“mode” is an existing term in Emacs so what Vim calls modes, Evil Mode calls “states”), (evil-define-motion), (evil-define-operator), (evil-define-text-object), and a few others.\nEvil Mode correctly implements the plumbing to wire these things together so that the Vim “language” which becomes natural and reflexive (e.g. di” -&gt; “delete inside double quotes”, vt  -&gt; “visually select till space`) is completely preserved. If you wanted to define a new text object (e.g. a Ruby block), it is trivial to do so and all of the motions and operators will work flawlessly with it immediately. Frankly, it’s not even that nice in Vim.\nAt the end of the day, I’ve always hated things like VimScript and Vim’s single-threadedness but I could never walk away from a truly powerful (and mostly extensible) modal editing system. Now, that has changed; I get ELisp (which, for all its faults, is exponentially better than VimScript), a saner package system, and a level of extensibility that, by design, can never be matched by Vim. All that and I don’t have to give up modal editing? Hell yes!\nBonus points: one of the “states” that Evil implements is an Emacs state; this leaves Emacs and all it’s default behavior and keymappings 100% intact, meaning you can pair fearlessly with Emacsen, or slowly learn more about the Emacs way of doing things, if desirable.\nSo far, I’ve rarely noticed I’m not in Vim and am constantly surprised when I employ Vim reflexes in Emacs and they work exactly as expected or better (seriously, try :%s/foo/bar/g in Evil mode and tell me you don’t squeal with joy).\nI refuse to pick a single side, so I’m picking both. I’m going to edit modally in Emacs and I’m going to be happy doing it! I don’t care if I simultaneously piss off Vim users and Emacs users — hell, they need more things in common anyway...\n","id":"https://bjeanes.com/posts/pure-evil/","title":"Pure Evil"},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/rails-bug-in-versions-1-2-and-3/":{"body":"Want to know how to raise a 500 error in any version of rails (so far)?\nSimply add ?a&amp;a[] to the end of any URL in any Rails application.\nI tested this on a number of known rails sites such as Chargify,\nTwitter, Groupon, Hoptoad (oh the irony), and even a Rails v1 website\nsomebody managed to find.\nFor such an old bug (essentially as old as it can be), it’s quite funny\nthat it was apparently patched less than two weeks\nago.\n","id":"https://bjeanes.com/posts/rails-bug-in-versions-1-2-and-3/","title":"Rails bug in versions 1, 2, and 3"},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/restoring-ghost-entries-from-time-machine-backup/":{"body":"Pat Allan just had some trouble with his laptop and he lost a bunch of\ndata.\nAfter he pinged me asking where ghost stored it’s hostname entries so he\ncould restore them, I realised I didn’t know.

It may be that the client doesn’t yet know the feel they want for\ntheir project or that they want to focus their budget towards\nprototyping the application first.\nThis is fine, except for the fact that changing the HTML and CSS of a\nweb application after a lot of functionality has been developed is a\nfantastic way to break all your integration tests.\nThis is particularly true if you have scenarios like the following\ncontrived one:\nWhen I fill in \"Username\" with \"bjeanes\" within \".main-panel form#signup-form\"\nAnd I press \"Sign up!\" within \".main-panel form#signup-form\"\nThen I should see \"You have successfully signed up\" within \".flash.notice\"\n\nThe problem is, of course, that designers might change the HTML that\nused to be .main-panel form#signup-form into something sexier and more\nsemantic.\nThe Solution\nThis problem is not unlike an already-solved one; we’ve all moved away\nfrom hardcoding URLs like \"/users/new\" into our views and Cucumber\nscenarios and replacing them with new_user_path and the signup page,\nrespectively.\nSo why not apply the same formula that paths.rb uses for removing URLs\nfrom scenarios to our situation with selectors?\nHere’s what I add to all new projects:\n# I'm in features/step_definitions/web_ext_steps.rb\n\nWhen /^(.*) within ([^:\"]+)$/ do |step, scope|\n  with_scope(selector_for(scope)) do\n    When step\n  end\nend\n\n# Multi-line version of above\nWhen /^(.*) within ([^:\"]+):$/ do |step, scope, table_or_string|\n  with_scope(selector_for(scope)) do\n    When \"#{step}:\", table_or_string\n  end\nend\n\nAnd:\n# I'm in features/support/selectors.rb\n\nmodule HtmlSelectorsHelper\n  def selector_for(scope)\n    case scope\n    when /the body/\n      \"html &gt; body\"\n    else\n      raise \"Can't find mapping from \\\"#{scope}\\\" to a selector.\\n\" +\n        \"Now, go and add a mapping in #{__FILE__}\"\n    end\n  end\nend\n\nWorld(HtmlSelectorsHelper)\n\nApplying the Solution\nMy previous example of the flawed Cucumber scenario now becomes:\nWhen I fill in \"Username\" with \"bjeanes\" within the sign up form\nAnd I press \"Sign up!\" within the sign up form\nThen I should see \"You have successfully signed up\" within the notice flash\n\nAnd the selectors.rb case statement gets the following additions:\ncase\n  # ...\n\n  when /the sign up form/\n    \".main-panel form#signup-form\"\n  when /the (notice|error|info) flash/\n    \".flash.#{$1}\"\n\n  # ...\nend\n\nNotice how the scenario now identifies things on our page by their\nsemantic identifiers, not by brittle CSS or XPath locations which are\nprone to change. As a bonus, now if when they do change, the paths only need to be updated in a single\nlocation in our Cucumber test suite!\nPatching Cucumber\nI feel pretty strongly that CSS and XPath don’t belong in our feature\nfiles because not only does it encourage brittle tests (as shown above),\nbut also because those selectors are entirely irrelevant to end users,\nand that’s kind of the main point of using a natural language DSL to\ndescribe our integration tests, i.e. putting on the user shoes.\n\nI’d really like to patch this back into Cucumber, and I entirely plan to\ndo so, providing I get the time.\n\nI got the time, and here is my [pull\nrequest](http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber-rails/pull/63) to have\nit merged.\nExpanding the Solution\nYou’ll note my HtmlSelectorsHelper module only accommodates CSS\nselectors. That’s only because I have never needed XPath in this\ncontext. It’d be very simple to modify my examples to do so, though,\nwith a combination of multiple return values and a splat. That’s an\nexercise for the reader (or me if I end up patching Cucumber).\nFinal Word\nI apologise for the length of this article, but I congratulate you for\nmaking it all the way through it!\nI now have so many blog post ideas lined up that I’ve had to create a\nnew category in Things.app just to hold them all. This means that I’ll\nbe striving to get a few more posts done and out the door in the next\nfew weeks, including a performance comparison of different data\nencapsulations for web application APIs on the iPhone (i.e. is it better\nto use Plists, JSON, or XML?) and a post on why I think there should be\n8 RESTful actions, not the 7 that Rails prescribes by default.\n","id":"https://bjeanes.com/posts/selector-free-cucumber-scenarios/","title":"Selector-Free Cucumber Scenarios"},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/snow-leopard-for-the-ruby-developer/":{"body":"After the 2009 WWDC release, I decided to give Snow Leopard a try on my\nproduction machine.

There are often hundreds of new tweets between \"hits,\" which means that during vulnerable times of the day (e.g. in bed before sleep), my brain is rapidly context switching hundreds of times in a matter of minutes.\nFor me, Twitter has always been about consuming information and learning. Despite the fear of \"missing out\" on interesting links or thoughts in my network[1], which is predominantly made of people I respect and trust, I decided that this rapid and varied consumption is not a healthy way to achieve this goal.\nIt's been two months since I uninstalled all Twitter (and Facebook) applications from all my devices. I still tweet occasionally (using iOS/Mac's Notification Center), but I make a point not to check the Twitter feed. I re-enabled email notifications for mentions and only log in to the web interface to reply to mentions/messages.\nI love it.

We didn't just override the behaviour in case there is a good reason to leave it, but here is our code:\nclass ActionView::Helpers::FormBuilder\n  def fields_for_with_nested_attributes_with_index_reset(association_name, args, block)\n    if args.last.is_a?(Hash) &amp;&amp; args.last[:reset_index]\n      @nested_child_index = nil\n    end\n\n    fields_for_without_nested_attributes_without_index_reset(association_name, args, block)\n  end\n\n  alias_method_change :fields_for_with_nested_attributes, :index_reset\nend\n\n","id":"https://bjeanes.com/posts/using-fields-for-with-nested-attributes-calling-it-multiple-times/","title":"Using fields_for with Nested Attributes, Calling it Multiple Times"},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/using-fish-shells-event-system-to-behave-like-method-missing/":{"body":"Dr Nic’s latest post, hash bang\ncucumber,\nreminded me of a piece of hax I whipped up a few weeks ago with Ruby and\nFish Shell.\nFish has an event system that allows you to register functions to be\nauto-run after or during certain events (such as when a particular\nenvironment variable is changed). One of this events is called\nfish_command_not_found. It is triggered whenever you type a\nnon-existant command into the prompt.\nWith this in mind, you can trigger certain commands to run by matching\nwhat fish couldn’t manage to run automatically by catching this event.\nFor instance:\nfunction __fish_method_missing --on-event fish_command_not_found\n  method_missing $argv\nend\n\nfuncsave method_missing\n\nGiven that function is created (simply paste the whole code block into\nyour Fish terminal), I can now create a command called\nmethod_missing (or whatever you call inside your\n__fish_method_missing) and place it somewhere in your $PATH — I like\n~/.config/fish/bin.\nMy method_missing binary is simply something like this:\n#!/usr/bin/env ruby\n\ncommand = ARGV.shift\n\ndef run(cmd)\n  puts \"Running #{cmd.inspect} instead\"\n  system(cmd)\nend\n\ncase command\nwhen /^git(@|:\\/\\/).*\\.git$/\n  run(\"git clone #{command.inspect}\")\nwhen /^(?:ftp|https?):\\/\\/.+\\.t(?:ar\\.)?gz$/\n  run(\"curl #{command.inspect} | tar xzv\")\nelse\n  $stderr.puts \"No default action defined in #{__FILE__.inspect}\"\n  abort\nend\n\nEach command you want to register just becomes a new when\nstatement. For instance, to implement the functionality Dr Nic was\ntrying to achieve, I simply modify the case block as such:\ncase command\nwhen /^[a-z0-9_\\-\\/]+\\.feature(:\\d+)?$/\n  run(\"cucumber #{command}\")\n# ... \nend\n\nThe existing entries I have in my method_missing command will\nauto-clone the repository of a pasted Git URL and download and expand a\nURL for a tar file, respectively. Not too shabby, and dead easy to\nimplement\n","id":"https://bjeanes.com/posts/using-fish-shells-event-system-to-behave-like-method-missing/","title":"Using Fish shell's event system to behave like method_missing"},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/using-partial-layouts-to-dry-out-your-views/":{"body":"The other day we got some HTML from the designer of one of our clients\nto implement as the new UI for an app we are building at\nMocra. Overall the HTML was good but implementing\nit started to feel a little moist (i.e. not DRY).\nFor example, around all the apps form the client’s design had a rounded\nwhite box, the HTML of which went something like this:\n&lt;div class=\"content-wht\"&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"content-wht-inside\"&gt;\n        &lt;fieldset&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"frow\"&gt;\n                &lt;label&gt;Currency:&lt;/label&gt;\n                &lt;select class=\"fs\"&gt;&lt;option&gt;EUR&lt;/option&gt;&lt;/select&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n\n            &lt;div class=\"frow frlast\"&gt;\n                &lt;label&gt;File:&lt;/label&gt;\n                &lt;input type=\"file\" name=\"\" /&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/fieldset&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=\"cround\" align=\"center\"&gt;\n    &lt;img src=\"/images/round-corners-bottom.gif\" alt=\"\" /&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\nIt’s a lot of div tags to have to repeat around every form that has\nthis style. Luckily a nice feature of Rails partials can help out.\nCreate a shared partial file that will act as a layout like this:\n&lt;!-- app/views/shared/_fieldset.html.erb --&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"content-wht\"&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"content-wht-inside\"&gt;\n        &lt;fieldset&gt;\n            &lt;%= yield %&gt;\n        &lt;/fieldset&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=\"cround\" align=\"center\"&gt;\n    &lt;img src=\"/images/round-corners-bottom.gif\" alt=\"\" /&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\nThen in your views that need to have this white box, simply wrap your\ncontent in that layout like so:\n&lt;% render :layout =&gt; 'shared/fieldset' do %&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"frow\"&gt;\n      &lt;label&gt;Currency:&lt;/label&gt;\n      &lt;select class=\"fs\"&gt;&lt;option&gt;EUR&lt;/option&gt;&lt;/select&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n\n  &lt;div class=\"frow frlast\"&gt;\n      &lt;label&gt;File:&lt;/label&gt;\n      &lt;input type=\"file\" name=\"\" /&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;% end %&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- Or, if the inner content is already in a partial --&gt;\n\n&lt;%= render, :partial =&gt; 'form', :layout =&gt; 'shared/fieldset' %&gt;\n\n","id":"https://bjeanes.com/posts/using-partial-layouts-to-dry-out-your-views/","title":"Using partial layouts to DRY out your views"}},"docInfo":{"https://bjeanes.com/":{"body":1,"title":2},"https://bjeanes.com/about/":{"body":33,"title":0},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/64-bit-postgres-and-rails-on-snow-leopard/":{"body":290,"title":6},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/a-collaborative-thought-experiment-on-company-environment-values-culture-and-ethos/":{"body":99,"title":8},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/australias-mandatory-internet-filter/":{"body":171,"title":4},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/automatically-open-the-last-page-for-failed-scenarios/":{"body":69,"title":6},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/automatically-refresh-staging-db/":{"body":680,"title":7},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/call-clojure-function-on-a-timer/":{"body":152,"title":4},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/code-formatting-in-rss-feeds/":{"body":46,"title":4},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/colemak/":{"body":241,"title":1},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/creating-new-postgres-user-and-db/":{"body":64,"title":5},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/critiquing-leadership-part-1-of-n-on-leadership/":{"body":93,"title":6},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/deploy-directory-to-branch/":{"body":599,"title":4},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/factories-breed-complexity/":{"body":492,"title":3},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/fish-shell-version-of-git-ps1-function-that-is-bundled-with-git/":{"body":206,"title":7},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/fix-encoding-errors-preventing-postgresql-database-creation/":{"body":86,"title":7},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/fix-for-dynamic-pager-cannot-open-swap-directory-private-var-vm-in-os-x-possibly-just-snow-leopard/":{"body":199,"title":11},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/fix-locale-errors-on-linux/":{"body":49,"title":4},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/generating-sound-from-sine-waves-on-the-iphone/":{"body":619,"title":5},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/ghost-manage-hostnames-effortlessly/":{"body":245,"title":4},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/gotcha-with-hash-new-when-providing-a-default-value/":{"body":214,"title":5},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/happier-as-a-hacker/":{"body":157,"title":2},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/hell-yes/":{"body":263,"title":2},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/how-to-prepare-your-mac-for-resale/":{"body":189,"title":3},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/iterative-html5-turning-a-comma-separated-list-into-a-semantic-list/":{"body":146,"title":8},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/makers-and-making/":{"body":206,"title":2},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/motivate-your-lazy-sequences/":{"body":453,"title":3},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/my-future/":{"body":212,"title":1},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/new-design/":{"body":44,"title":2},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/option-keyboard-shortcuts-for-terminal-and-iterm/":{"body":211,"title":6},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/options-to-improve-time-to-profit/":{"body":30,"title":4},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/pausing-cucumber-scenarios-to-debug/":{"body":78,"title":4},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/pure-evil/":{"body":391,"title":2},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/rails-bug-in-versions-1-2-and-3/":{"body":48,"title":6},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/restoring-ghost-entries-from-time-machine-backup/":{"body":67,"title":6},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/rubycocoa-and-keychain-access/":{"body":341,"title":3},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/selector-free-cucumber-scenarios/":{"body":440,"title":4},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/snow-leopard-for-the-ruby-developer/":{"body":252,"title":4},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/talk-ssh-can-do-that/":{"body":20,"title":2},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/two-months-without-twitter/":{"body":132,"title":4},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/ultraviolet-tools/":{"body":122,"title":2},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/unescaping-utf-8-strings-in-ruby-1-9/":{"body":97,"title":6},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/using-accepts-nested-attributes-for-when-the-child-object-validates-presence-of-parent/":{"body":169,"title":6},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/using-alterego-with-activerecord/":{"body":156,"title":3},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/using-apache-as-a-basicauth-proxy-to-an-internal-resource/":{"body":145,"title":6},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/using-fields-for-can-generate-invalid-html/":{"body":256,"title":5},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/using-fields-for-with-nested-attributes-calling-it-multiple-times/":{"body":123,"title":7},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/using-fish-shells-event-system-to-behave-like-method-missing/":{"body":172,"title":7},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/using-partial-layouts-to-dry-out-your-views/":{"body":164,"title":6}},"length":50},"lang":"English"};
