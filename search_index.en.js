For example, good data allows\ndevelopers to check that new features behave as expected with real-world data,\nthat a bugfix actually fixes a bug for a known scenario, or to benchmark a\ndatabase migration or the performance of new code.\nLike many technology companies, at Covidence we\nuse staging environment in a number of these critical ways, and more. In fact,\nwe actually use several different staging environments, some persistent and\nsome temporary.\n\nProduction Deployments\nIn production, we run two main deployments: production and demo. Our\nproduction environment is... just that. Our demo environment is version of\nour application that acts as a kind of playground for potential customers to\nevaluate our product or for existing customers to learn or experiment with the\nproduct without risking their production data. Data in this environment is\nexpunged on a rolling basis.\nNon-production Deployments\nIn staging, we have one environment each to mirror the production versions:\nstaging and demo-staging. These two deployments automatically get the\nlatest version of the code that has passed our continuous integration test\nsuite. The expectation is that these environments should be reasonably stable\nand relatively safe to deploy to the production environments.\nAdditionally, we have a dev environment which deploys the latest code,\nregardless of build status. This environment is expected to be less stable and\nis sometimes used to deploy feature branches that need to see production\nquality data before it can be merged to master. This also tends to be the\nenvironment in which migrations are tested and benchmarked.\nLastly, we use an excellent feature of Heroku Pipelines to create disposable\nstaging apps for any open pull request to allow us to sanity check and QA test\nthe change.\nData\nOf all those environments, only the pull request apps have \"seed\" data.\nstaging, demo-staging, and dev always have a recent snapshot of\nproduction data to work with.\nKeeping fresh production quality data in staging environments is a really\ncommon problem for many companies and can often go along time without a\nsolution. However, we knew that it was an important problem to solve if we were\nto work efficiently and effectively with our small team.\nI want to share how we leverage some handy features of Heroku\nPostgres to have effortless, push-button\nproduction quality data in these staging environments.\nScheduled and push-button database forks\nBasically, we use Heroku's database \"forking\" functionality, environment\nvariable-based configuration and database promotion, the Heroku Toolbelt, and a\nfew Heroku API calls to orchestrate a replacement DB.\nWe wrap up these steps in a script which runs every Sunday night via a\nscheduled Buildkite job or whenever we push the \"Build\" button manually. This\nmeans that our staging environment is never stale by more than about a week.\nThe steps to do this for each app are:\n\nCreate a new database as a --fast --fork of the production database, which\nwill use a compination of Postgres Write-Ahead Logs and leader-follower\nreplication to relatively quickly prepare a new database as a replica and\nonce it has caught up to the primary database, will separate from it as a\nstandalone instance.\nKeep track of the name of the old DB and the new DB.\nWhen the replica is fully prepared and ready to process queries, promote it\nvia environment variables on and a restart of the application.\nDe-provision the old database so we aren't paying for it.\n\nFor our demo to demo-staging copy, the dataset is actually so small that we\nare using cheaper plans which don't support Heroku's forking, so for that we do\nsomething slightly different:\n\nCreate new database\nInitiate a copy of data from the production version to staging version\n(essentially a dump and then restore)\nOnce complete, promote new database and de-provision old one, as above.\n\nCode\nHere's the actual script we use, more-or-less un-changed:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nset -ex\n\n# Pass in Heroku API token\ntoken=$1\n\n# We run this script in a stateless Docker image, so to make the script a bit\n# cleaner, we just write out the credentials to a file that the Heroku Toolbelt\n# knows to read.\nif ! grep -lq api.heroku.com ~/.netrc 2&gt;/dev/null; then\n  echo \"machine api.heroku.com\" &gt; ~/.netrc\n  echo \"  login dev+heroku@covidence.org\" &gt;&gt; ~/.netrc\n  echo \"  password $token\" &gt;&gt; ~/.netrc\n\n  chmod 0600 ~/.netrc\nfi\n\n# Helper function for calling Heroku API\nfunction hapi {\n  curl \\\n    --fail \\\n    --silent \\\n    --netrc \\\n    --header 'Accept: application/vnd.heroku+json; version=3' \\\n    https://api.heroku.com$*\n}\n\n# Routine to wait for DB to be caught up, then promote it and de-provision the\n# old instance.\nfunction promote {\n  app=$1\n\n  heroku pg:wait --wait-interval 10 -a $app\n  heroku pg:unfollow -a $app --confirm $app $app::NEW_DATABASE || true\n  heroku addons:attach -a $app $app::DATABASE --as OLD_DATABASE\n  heroku pg:promote -a $app NEW_DATABASE\n  heroku addons:detach -a $app NEW_DATABASE\n  heroku addons:destroy -a $app --confirm $app OLD_DATABASE\n  heroku run:detached -a $app rails runner 'Ops::Staging::Search.massacre!'\n}\n\n# Routine to create a new DB with a deterministic name so that we can more\n# easily promote it later.\n#\n# There is also some logic here to recover from a build which got interrupted\n# mid-way so that we don't accumulate orphaned DBs that we have to pay for.\nfunction create {\n  app=$1\n  plan=$2\n\n  shift 2\n\n  existing=$(hapi /addons/$app::DATABASE | jq -Mr .name)\n  new=$(hapi /addons/$app::NEW_DATABASE | jq -Mr .name || true)\n\n  if [ -z \"$new\" ]; then\n    heroku addons:create \\\n      -a $app heroku-postgresql:$plan \\\n      --as NEW_DATABASE \\\n      $*\n  else\n    if [ \"$new\" == \"$existing\" ]; then\n      heroku addons:detach -a $app NEW_DATABASE\n      create $app $plan\n    else\n      true # already got a new one in waiting\n    fi\n  fi\n}\n\n# Takes a snapshot and copies it.

This is what it looks like:\n\nI was instantly intrigued and was drawn to a few key features:\n\nEasy to learn\nCaps lock is replaced with backspace (making backspace closer to fingers and getting rid of the useless caps lock)\nObvious health benefits (just look how much your fingers need to move when using QWERTY\nhere)\nIt’s not QWERTY, which was designed without any consideration to ergonomic or efficiency\naspects.\n\nLong story short: it took me a few tries to commit to learning it (3 tries over year in fact). Eventually I went cold\nturkey for a week and haven’t looked back. Typing is more comfortable and faster already.\nGetting Colemak on OS X is as simple as following the simple Installation instructions. The\ninstructions seem out of date when it comes to re-mapping caps lock to backspace. It is as simple as downloading\nPCKeyboardHack, installing it, rebooting, and choosing\nthe option in its preference pane to remap caps lock to delete (key code 51).\nSnow Leopard\nColemak itself works fine under Snow Leopard, however the PCKeyboardHack utility does not work, because it is hardcoded\nto only load the kernel driver if it recognises the OS version. Luckily it is open source, and I was able to import the\nMercurial project into a GitHub project, modify it, and build a version that\nworks fine on Snow Leopard.\nDead Keys that Apple uses on the QWERTY layout\nOne thing I loved about the QWERTY layout on OS X was the sensible dead key and alternate character behaviours, allowing\nusers to quickly and logically input characters such as: , é, ¡, ¿, », ‡, °, etc. The version of Colemak, for one\nreason or another, moved or simply didn’t have many of these shortcuts.\nSo, I created my own Colemak layout bundle that moves the dead key positions to preserve the associations with the\ncharacter position changes from QWERTY to Colemak. This means, for example,  can be created by pressing ⌥⇧K on either\nkeyboard layout (where K is the key that outputs K, not the key that physically says K on it).\nMy version of the Colemak bundle is available on my GitHub.  Simply put the\n.bundle file in your ~/Library/Keyboard Layouts directory. The bundle includes both the original keyboard layout and\nmy re-created one so you can switch between them if you need both, for any reason.\n","id":"https://bjeanes.com/posts/colemak/","title":"Colemak"},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/deploy-directory-to-branch/":{"body":"This post outlines a mechanism for using one branch as the source to generate a compiled artifact into another branch.\nThis is achieved without resorting to moving files around a working directory and staging dirty changes away safely, by\nleveraging some neat internals of Git.\nWhy?\nBut first, why would someone want to do this?\nIn general, storing (deterministically) buildable artifacts in a repository can be unneccessary and even problematic.\nFor example: building a binary which can't run on all platforms that might use the repository; or creating large files\nwhich grow the repository size rapidly (e.g. JARs).\nIn the past, I have been in situations where using Git's object model to storean immutable history of changes in\ncompiled outputs has been useful, inparticular for analytical purposes.\nHowever, this time, the reason is rather mundane: GitHub's Jekyll compilation whitelists certain plugins (for good,\nsecurity-related reasons) and I had set up this blog using a theme and plugin combination that apparently is not\ncompatible with GitHub-built Jekyll projects.\nHow\nGitHub expects to find source files for GitHub Pages deployment in either the gh-pages or main branch (depending on\nwhether its building a project page or a user/org page). All that was necessary was to generate the compiled files into\nthat appropriate branch.\nHowever, I did not want it to be up to the person making changes to the blog to have to remember to generate and commit\nthe generated files. In addition, it was important to me that the Git history of source changes was not conflated with\nthe adjacent need to store the compiled version.\nThat meant:\n\nAs much automated as possible\nThe compiled branch (main, in this case) should be nothing but the generated files and a separate commit history.\n\nUnderstanding git commit\nWhen you run a command like git commit ., Git is doing a few of things of interest internally:\n\ngit-write-tree stores the current state of your (staged) files as a tree\ngit-commit-tree creates a commit for that tree (and, usually, a parent\ncommit)\ngit-update-ref Updating a ref (branch) to point to that new commit\n\nBy dropping down a level and taking control of these primitives directly, we can actually exercise a little bit more\ncontrol over what is in the commit and how that commit relates to the rest of the repository's history.\nWriting a tree at a custom root\nThe key ingredient that we will leverage is the --prefix flag to git-write-tree. This allows us to create a tree\nobject rooted at an arbitrary directory!\nFor example, compare the following:\n$ git show $(git write-tree)\ntree c97ce6b80599da62e34a684a245dec5df1228b8d\n\n.buildkite/\n.gitignore\nCNAME\nGemfile\nGemfile.lock\n_config.yml\n_data/\n_drafts/\nassets/\nbin/\nindex.html\npages/\n\n$ git show $(git write-tree --prefix pages)\ntree 8e479816fadad469d16bcb16c24413feb780765f\n\narchive.html\ncategory.html\ntag.html\n\nPiecing it together\nThe main caveat to account for is that git-write-tree will only write staged or committed files. I don't want to keep\nthe built files in the source branch so I have the build directory ignored, which means those files are neither\ncommitted nor staged.\nTo work around this, a bin/deploy script temporarily stages the files for the duration of the commit building.\nNOTE, because I am deploying to main branch, I configured the repository's default branch to be source and the\nbin/deploy script lived there, along with all the Jekyll source files.\nHere's a simplified version of the script:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nbranch=\"main\"\nbuild_dir=\"dist\"\n\n# This can be substituted for any command which builds artifacts to a\n# specific directory\nbundle exec jekyll build --destination $build_dir\n\n# Force the files to be added, regardless of .gitignore\ngit add -f $build_dir\n\n# Write tree to an object\ntree=$(git write-tree --prefix=$build_dir)\n\n# Un-stage the build so it is back to being ignored\ngit reset -- $build_dir\n\n# Create a new commit for that tree as a child of target branch's commit\ncommit=$(git commit-tree -p $branch -m \"Deploy\" $tree)\n\n# Update the GitHub Pages' branch to the new commit\ngit update-ref refs/heads/$branch $commit\n\n# Push the compiled branch to GitHub\ngit push origin $branch\n\nAutomated builds\nI used our existing Buildkite CI setup to quickly add a build which essentially just called\nbin/deploy to automatically deploy changes we made to GitHub (much the way that GitHub would automatically deploy\nchanges if I were committing directly to main/gh-pages).\nSome changes for resilience\n\n\nI wanted to preserve committer/authorship metadata for the deploy commits to make it clear whose latest change is\ndeployed. To handle this, the bin/deploy script takes these details from the commit being built and sets some env\nvars before we generate the deploy commit:\nexport GIT_AUTHOR_NAME=$(git show -s --format='%an' HEAD)\nexport GIT_COMMITTER_NAME=\"$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME\"\nexport GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL=$(git show -s --format='%ae' HEAD)\nexport GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL=\"$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL\"\n\ncommit=$(git commit-tree -p $branch -m \"Deploy\" $tree)\n\n\n\nI wanted to make it clear which commit had been deployed, so I augmented the commit creation step to record a\ndescription of the source commit in the commit message, including whether or not the working directory had uncommitted\nchanges:\nidentifier=$(git describe --dirty --always) # e.g. \"213c9af\", \"213c9a-dirty\"\ncommit=$(git commit-tree -p $branch -m \"Deploy $identifier\" $tree)\n\n\n\nFor maximum re-usability, I have the script detect the target branch based on the type of repository (project or\nuser/org):\n# Determine which branch GitHub pages is built from, for this repository\nremote=$(git config remote.origin.url)\nif [[ $remote = *.github.io ]] || [[ $remote = *.github.io.git ]]; then\n  branch=main\nelse\n  branch=gh-pages\nfi\n\n\n\nTo still work in CI where a clean checkout has occurred without necessarily creating local branch refs, I use\nlong-form names (refs/remotes/origin/$branch or refs/heads/$branch, as appropriate)\n\n\nResult\nFeel free to have a look at the repository for the blog.

My new blog doesn't have comments so until I find a way to\ncapture them here, please view the old version via Wayback\nMachine.\nHaving maintainable code is great. Maintainable code allows you to deliver improvements faster, happier, and more\nreliably.\nFurthermore, the measures that developers need to take and the strategies that we have to employ to achieve maintainable\ncode have been understood for years, if not decades. Especially in the realm of object-oriented programming, but\ncertainly not exclusively, most of these principles boil down to reducing coupling and system complexity. A system whose\nparts are coupled as loosely as possible is a modular system; the parts know little of each other and a lot about\nthemselves and they have thin and specific interfaces between each other.\nTest-driven development is one of the many tools at a developer's disposal to achieve code quality. Unfortunately, there\nis a lot of naïveté around the benefits of TDD. A lot of developers see TDD as primarily a tool for verifying system\ncorrectness. While TDD does of course offer this benefit, and arguably better than retroactive automated testing, the\nreal benefit of TDD is that it offers short feedback loops that guide the design/architecture of the system.\nSince it is accepted that a loosely-coupled modular system is a simpler system, it stands that tools, such as TDD, which\nguide a design towards modularity and simplicity are good tools. A module that is tightly coupled to another is not\neasily tested in isolation. However, if the isolated tests are written first, it is difficult to write a passing\nimplementation for that module that maintains such a low degree of coupling. Therefore, good TDD should guide you\ntowards a simpler design (though it is certainly not the only way).\nUnfortunately, factories work against this goal. Factories debilitate TDD's ability to give you feedback into the\ncomplexity of your design.\nTo be clear, I am not talking about the Factory Method Pattern or\nthe Abstract Factory Pattern — both of which can be described\nas ways to decouple a particular implementation\nof an object from code for the creation of such an object\n(Wikipedia). Instead, I am talking about\nthe \"factories\" for replacing fixtures in tests —&nbsp;something which has seemingly obsessed the Ruby (Rails, especially)\ncommunity. The two primary Ruby libraries for factory-based fixture replacement are\nfactory_girl and Machinist.\nA tool such as Machinist or factory_girl generates data for the attributes you don't care about, and constructs any\nnecessary associated objects, leaving you to specify only the fields you care about in your test (from Machinist's\nown README file). This sounds nice at first, because\nit makes your tests more readable and relevant. However, behind the scenes, these tools are still creating other objects\nand entities and introducing them into your test environment. By having data and objects in tests that are irrelevant to\nthe functionality that is being tested (in isolation, remember), a developer creates an environment that permits, if\nnot invites, silent dependencies to creep into an implementation.\nFurthermore, and perhaps more significantly, by creating objects (and usually entire hierarchies of objects) with such\nease and opacity, you are outright masking the dependencies (*cough* complexity *cough* coupling) between your\nimplementation and those entities. If forced to stub out all those intricacies, the system complexity would be\nscreamingly obvious and a developer would quickly avail herself of a rewrite to reduce complexity or thin out the\ninterface.\nInstead of having feedback that guides a developer to simplicity, fixture factories seem to guide developers to\ncomplexity by masking dependencies as one-line simplicity. In fact, that one (or five, whatever) line setup is a shotgun\nblast of environmental dependencies that are hidden from the architect. That complexity will come back for revenge after\nbeing ignored for so long.\nIt seems that factory_girl and Machinist exist to make testing components more convenient. This is, at face value, an\nadmirable and desirable goal. However, in unit tests, the cost is too high for any system of considerable size.\nPlease, do the right thing and avoid the convenience and \"fun\" of the factory_girl temptress. You will trend towards a\nsimpler system and as a bonus (in fact, an incredible one) your test suite will likely be exponentially faster which, in\nturn, will breed simplicity by letting you have more feedback more often.\nP.S. It shouldn't go without mention that factories can be absolutely awesome for integration tests. Integration tests\naren't used for guiding system design nor testing in isolation so the drawbacks of these tools drop away. However, both\nfactory_girl and Machinist use RSpec as some of their very first usage examples and this troubles me deeply.\nP.P.S. A lot of these arguments can be applied to fixtures too. However, they usually don't create hordes of objects\ninvisibly and litter your environment with them. Also, they aren't as slow. But yes, the fewer factories and fixtures\nin a test, the better.\nUpdate for clarity: Firstly, I am absolutely just talking about unit tests. If you are testing code that\nintegrates with ActiveRecord or number of levels of your stack, then factories and fixtures are certainly defensible\n(though I still prefer to steer clear). Secondly, I've tried to be careful about where I use the words simple, easy,\ncomplex, and difficult.

Whenever we thought we had a clean note working, we’d change\nthe frequency to what should be another nice clean note, and would\ninstead get ear-shattering screeches.\nNonetheless we persevered and were even able to come up with a nifty\nlittle piece of code that could take an array of frequencies and play\nthem together in what could be made to sound like a pleasant chord.\nHere is the relevant code:\nCode\nTonePlayer.h\n#import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;\n#include &lt;AudioUnit/AudioUnit.h&gt;\n#include &lt;math.h&gt;\n\n#define kTonesAvailable 16\n#define kOutputBus 0\n#define kInputBus 1\n#define kNumChannels 2\n\n@interface TonePlayer : NSObject {\n  AudioComponentInstance audioUnit;\n  AudioStreamBasicDescription audioFormat;\n  float phase[kTonesAvailable];\n  float frequencies[kTonesAvailable];\n}\n\n-(OSStatus)start;\n-(OSStatus)stop;\n-(void)resetFrequencies;\n-(void)cleanUp;\n-(void)intialiseAudio;\n@end\n\n// Some C function headers to get arount compile errors while I refactor to be more readable\nfloat phaseOffsetFromFrequency(float);\nOSStatus RenderCallback(void*, AudioUnitRenderActionFlags*, const AudioTimeStamp*, UInt32, UInt32, AudioBufferList*);\n\nTonePlayer.m\n#import \"TonePlayer.h\"\n\ntypedef struct {\n  @defs(TonePlayer);\n} SinewaveDef;\n\n@implementation TonePlayer\n\nstatic float gSampleRate = 44100.;\nstatic float notes[111]  = {\n      8.1758, 8.6620, 9.1770, 9.7227, 10.3009, 10.9134, 11.5623, 12.2499,\n      12.9783, 13.7500, 14.5676, 15.4339, 16.3516, 17.3239, 18.3540, 19.4454,\n      20.6017, 21.8268, 23.1247, 24.4997, 25.9565, 27.5000, 29.1352, 30.8677,\n      32.7032, 34.6478, 36.7081, 38.8909, 41.2034, 43.6535, 46.2493, 48.9994,\n      51.9131, 55.0000, 58.2705, 61.7354, 65.4064, 69.2957, 73.4162, 77.7817,\n      82.4069, 87.3071, 92.4986, 97.9989, 103.8262, 110.0000, 116.5409, 123.4708,\n      130.8128, 138.5913, 146.8324, 155.5635, 164.8138, 174.6141, 184.9972,\n      195.9977, 207.6523, 220.0000, 233.0819, 246.9417, 261.6256, 277.1826,\n      293.6648, 311.1270, 329.6276, 349.2282, 369.9944, 391.9954, 415.3047,\n      440.0000, 466.1638, 493.8833, 523.2511, 554.3653, 587.3295, 622.2540,\n      659.2551, 698.4565, 739.9888, 783.9909, 830.6094, 880.0000, 932.3275,\n      987.7666, 1046.5023, 1108.7305, 1174.6591, 1244.5079, 1318.5102, 1396.9129,\n      1479.9777, 1567.9817, 1661.2188, 1760.0000, 1864.6550, 1975.5332, 2093.0045,\n      2217.4610, 2349.3181, 2489.0159, 2637.0205, 2793.8259, 2959.9554, 3135.9635,\n      3322.4376, 3520.0000, 3729.3101, 3951.0664, 4186.0090, 4434.9221, 4698.6363\n  };\n\nOSStatus    RenderCallback(void                          *inRefCon,\n                           AudioUnitRenderActionFlags    *ioActionFlags,\n                           const AudioTimeStamp          *inTimeStamp,\n                           UInt32                        inBusNumber,\n                           UInt32                        inNumberFrames,\n                           AudioBufferList               *ioData)\n{\n  SinewaveDef* def = inRefCon;\n\n  float *outL = ioData-&gt;mBuffers[0].mData;\n  float *outR = ioData-&gt;mBuffers[1].mData;\n\n  float wave, j;\n  float freqs[kTonesAvailable];\n\n  memset(freqs, 0.0f, sizeof(freqs));\n\n  for (int i=0;

I had plenty of freelance work and plenty of time to find the\nright fit for myself. With this in mind, I decided to adopt a new philosophy to apply in situations like this.\nI realised that you don’t always get the full potential out of life until you face up to what you really want out of\nit.\nThe core principle of this outlook was inspired by reading a fantastic blog post that had\none message: If you can’t say “HELL YEAH!” to something, just say “No” instead.\nThis message resonated with me and helped me considerably to get what I really wanted out of the next few months. I knew\nthat what I really wanted more than anything was to work with incredible people who inspired and challenged me on a\ndaily basis. I knew then and still do now that if this basic need wasn’t met, I’d be looking for a new job within a few\nmonths.\nI knew that to make the best of my time, I had to take my time. I put the word out to the world (via a blog\npost) stating what I wanted and began networking and contacting companies I\nthought I’d like.\nOne of the first things I did when I got on the phone with any potential employer was to tell them that I would not be\naccepting any jobs immediately. I wanted to take at least a few months to get a good feel for the work places and the\npeople of which they were comprised.\nI was contacted by nine fantastic opportunities across the world. They included opportunities in Sweden, Spain, Mexico,\nthe USA, Canada, and my home, Australia.\nWith each opportunity, I stated that I wanted to come to their office (anywhere in the world) and spend a week working\nwith the people who would become my coworkers and on the projects that I would be a part of.\nAfter several experiences at different locations, I had the pleasure of spending a week in Chicago with the Obtivians.\nFinally, this was a place I knew I wanted to work at. Obtiva has some of the most amazing people I’ve had the pleasure\nof getting to know. Each of them is smart, passionate, interesting, modest, and inspiring. I knew I could only come out\nthe other end of working with them a better developer and human being than before.\nSeveral of my visits with offices prior to Obtiva felt like interesting and challenging places to work at, but none of\nthem gave me an overwhelming sensation of happiness and excitement as Obtiva did and still does.\nUltimately, I don’t plan on being a consultant for most of my career, but I know that as long as I am one, I want to be\none with these guys.\nSo, face up to what you want. Say no until you are moved to say yes as though by an external force (other than\ncoercion!). There's no room for compromising on happiness, fulfillment, and personal growth.\nAlso, Obtiva kicks ass. If you are a passionate developer or have an interesting project, drop us a line, and let us\nmove you to say \"HELL YES!\"\n","id":"https://bjeanes.com/posts/hell-yes/","title":"Hell yes"},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/how-to-prepare-your-mac-for-resale/":{"body":"First thing is first: you want to re-install Mac OS X (this guide requires Leopard).

Gary Fredericks, Mike Busch, and I applied this to a project of ours that had to crunch tens of thousands of records from Salesforce. I’m also doing something similar with a personal project that has to fetch a lot of Pivotal Tracker stories to reduce them.\nIn cases like these, consuming (potentially unbounded) resources in a lazy manner allows one to start processing data earlier and to make as few requests as possible to get only the data you need.\nMostly Lazy\nI want to talk about a neat little thing I did in my project to get a nice little performance boost on top of this laziness, without having to think about any low-level concurrency concerns.\nLaziness\nHere’s a piece of code that provides an “infinite” lazy sequence. In this case, it is of tweets:\n(require '[clj-http.client :as http])\n\n(defn tweets-for\n  ([user] (tweets-for user nil))\n  ([user last-tweet-id]\n     (lazy-seq\n      (let [url \"http://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/user_timeline.json\"\n            params {:limit 10 :screen_name user}\n            params (if last-tweet-id (assoc params :max_id last-tweet-id) params)\n            response (http/get url {:query-params params :as :json})\n            tweets (:body response)]\n\n        (when (not-empty tweets)\n          (concat tweets\n                  (tweets-for user (:id (last tweets)))))))))\n\nSo that’s cool. Now, note the following performance characteristics when contemplating the next section:\n(def my-tweets (tweets-for \"bjeanes\"))\n\n;; The following returns after a delay while we fetch the first page:\n(first my-tweets) ;=&gt; {:text \"Tweet 0\" ...}\n\n;; This returns instantly because our `tweets-for` function fetches 10 tweets per page:\n(nth my-tweets 9) ;=&gt; {:text \"Tweet 9\" ...}\n\n;; This returns after a delay because this tweet is on the next (still lazily unfetched) page:\n(nth my-tweets 10) ;=&gt; {:text \"Tweet 10\" ...}\n\nMotivation\nSo laziness is pretty cool. But, sometimes, things can improve if you are ever so slightly less lazy. What if we could remove that little pause between the 9th and the 10th items in the list where we are just waiting around for the network request to Twitter to complete? We could be using our time to do more CPU-melting tweet crunching! Well, it turns out we can easily do it.\nAssume for a moment that we have some calculation (process) that takes a considerable amount of CPU time to process:\n(defn process\n  \"Do some really hard work with our tweets\"\n  [tweets]\n  (map #(Thread/sleep 100) tweets))\n\nIf we know we will be consuming a substantial amount of the lazy sequence, we could encourage the sequence to go ahead and start realizing the next chunk of our sequence.\nThis would mean that instead of processing 10 tweets, waiting, processing 10 tweets, waiting, etc.:\n\n... we would be able to process tweets continuously back-to-back:\n\nWouldn't also be great if we didn't have to think about the parallelism at all? To this end, I present motivate:\n(defn motivate\n  \"Motivate a lazy sequence to seek slightly ahead of the sequence consumer's position.\"\n  ([coll] (motivate coll 1))\n  ([coll motivation]\n     (lazy-seq\n      (future (nth coll motivation))\n      (cons (first coll) (motivate (rest coll) motivation)))))\n\nLet’s compare:\n(time (process (take 100 (tweets-for \"riblah\"))))\n;=&gt; “Elapsed time: 11545.011 msecs\"\n(time (process (take 100 (motivate (tweets-for \"riblah\") 5))))\n;=&gt; \"Elapsed time: 10394.769 msecs\"\n\nThe speed difference is noticeable even when processing only a 100 tweets. If we were doing more than 100 milliseconds/tweet of processing, fetching a lot more data, or dealing with a slow upstream dependency, the speed improvements would be even clearer.\nThe last (optional) parameter to motivate is the “motivation factor”. If your CPU-bound work is long-running, this number can be smaller without a noticeable difference. The ideal number depends on how long each IO operation takes and much processing you do with each chunk.\nEssentially, the motivation you give to the lazy sequence is a trade-off between waiting for IO and wasting IO; that is, the lower the number, the more likely you are to wait on IO but the higher the number, the more IO you’ll perform unnecessarily (at least, if you aren’t guaranteed to consume the whole sequence.\nHopefully this is handy to someone else out there. I wouldn’t at all be surprised if something like this already existed (UPDATE Yup: seque) or if this completely obvious to seasoned Clojurian, but it was a pleasant moment discovering this possibility on my own.\n","id":"https://bjeanes.com/posts/motivate-your-lazy-sequences/","title":"Motivate your lazy sequences"},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/pure-evil/":{"body":"I love Vim. I take that back — I love modal editing.\nActually, I think very few people like Vim, it just happens to be the best kid on the block at modal editing. But,\nafter using Vim (and, God, does it take a while to learn to use it), you are reduced to a pathetic teary wreck\nevery time you have to use a text editor that isn't vim.\nAnd why is it so debilitating to use something other than Vim for those who have honed their modal editing skills?\nFrankly, magic sauce of Vim is (mostly) made up from a few quite simple ingredients: motions, text objects, operators.\nThere are plenty of cool tricks hidden inside Vim, but those three main things are the things you really miss,\nconsistently, when using something else.\nEvery now and then, when forced outside of the comforting (yet somehow cold) embrace of Vim, the Vimmer flirts with\nSublime Text 2’s vintage mode or\nIdeaVIM. We may even be impressed — but, eventually, something falls apart\nand the abstraction leaks.\nUsually, this failure happens because the Vi(m) emulation layer often doesn’t implement motions, text objects, and\noperators. They just implement some keystrokes that appear to do the same thing in the same way —&nbsp;until you try\nsomething the developer didn’t preempt.\nIf I could have an editor that did these things properly, I would have no real attachment to Vim. I have other things\nabout Vim that I love and would hate to lose but they aren’t unique and other editors (can) have them, too.\nLuckily for me, I’ve been doing too much Clojure to ignore Emacs forever and 2 weeks ago, I switched. Here's how it\nplayed out:\n\nNope —&nbsp;not for me... But, wait! Let us try this Evil Mode so we can mock their\npitiful attempt at modal editing (evil laugh here).  What’s this‽ It’s actually good!\n\nInner dialogs aside, I’m not kidding; Evil Mode is stunning. It doesn’t have everything —&nbsp;but everything that it does\nhave is built up using the same functions macros that you can use to extend it. Those are:\n(evil-define-state) (“mode” is an existing term in Emacs so what Vim calls modes, Evil Mode calls “states”),\n(evil-define-motion), (evil-define-operator), (evil-define-text-object), and a few\nothers.\nEvil Mode correctly implements the plumbing to wire these things together so that the Vim “language” which becomes\nnatural and reflexive (e.g. di” -&gt; “delete inside double quotes”, vt  -&gt; “visually select till\nspace`) is completely preserved. If you wanted to define a new text object (e.g. a Ruby block), it is trivial to do so\nand all of the motions and operators will work flawlessly with it immediately. Frankly, it’s not even that nice in Vim.\nAt the end of the day, I’ve always hated things like VimScript and Vim’s single-threadedness but I could never walk away\nfrom a truly powerful (and mostly extensible) modal editing system. Now, that has changed; I get ELisp (which, for all\nits faults, is exponentially better than VimScript), a saner package system, and a level of extensibility that, by\ndesign, can never be matched by Vim. All that and I don’t have to give up modal editing? Hell yes!\nBonus points: one of the “states” that Evil implements is an Emacs state; this leaves Emacs and all it’s default\nbehavior and keymappings 100% intact, meaning you can pair fearlessly with Emacsen, or slowly learn more about the Emacs\nway of doing things, if desirable.\nSo far, I’ve rarely noticed I’m not in Vim and am constantly surprised when I employ Vim reflexes in Emacs and they work\nexactly as expected or better (seriously, try :%s/foo/bar/g in Evil mode and tell me you don’t squeal with joy).\nI refuse to pick a single side, so I’m picking both. I’m going to edit modally in Emacs and I’m going to be happy doing\nit! I don’t care if I simultaneously piss off Vim users and Emacs users — hell, they need more things in common\nanyway...\n","id":"https://bjeanes.com/posts/pure-evil/","title":"Pure Evil"},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/rubycocoa-and-keychain-access/":{"body":"There have been a few posts asking how to access and manipulate the Keychain from within RubyCocoa but no answers\nsupplied.

I’ve worked on a lot of projects that have\nrelied on it’s presence for reliable development. Therefore, I’ve put a lot of effort into perfecting my Cucumber\ninfrastructure to make this fantastic tool even better. I’m going to share one such morsel of code that makes developing\nwith Cucumber even greater.\nThe Problem\nI’ve worked on a lot of web applications and, as I’m sure many of you know, quite often the development of a web\napplication is focussed on the functionality foremost, and the interface and style is incorporated later. It may be that\nthe client doesn’t yet know the feel they want for their project or that they want to focus their budget towards\nprototyping the application first.\nThis is fine, except for the fact that changing the HTML and CSS of a web application after a lot of functionality has\nbeen developed is a fantastic way to break all your integration tests.\nThis is particularly true if you have scenarios like the following contrived one:\nWhen I fill in \"Username\" with \"bjeanes\" within \".main-panel form#signup-form\"\nAnd I press \"Sign up!\" within \".main-panel form#signup-form\"\nThen I should see \"You have successfully signed up\" within \".flash.notice\"\n\nThe problem is, of course, that designers might change the HTML that used to be .main-panel form#signup-form into\nsomething sexier and more semantic.\nThe Solution\nThis problem is not unlike an already-solved one; we’ve all moved away from hardcoding URLs like \"/users/new\" into our\nviews and Cucumber scenarios and replacing them with new_user_path and the signup page, respectively.\nSo why not apply the same formula that paths.rb uses for removing URLs from scenarios to our situation with selectors?\nHere’s what I add to all new projects:\n# I'm in features/step_definitions/web_ext_steps.rb\n\nWhen /^(.*) within ([^:\"]+)$/ do |step, scope|\n  with_scope(selector_for(scope)) do\n    When step\n  end\nend\n\n# Multi-line version of above\nWhen /^(.*) within ([^:\"]+):$/ do |step, scope, table_or_string|\n  with_scope(selector_for(scope)) do\n    When \"#{step}:\", table_or_string\n  end\nend\n\nAnd:\n# I'm in features/support/selectors.rb\n\nmodule HtmlSelectorsHelper\n  def selector_for(scope)\n    case scope\n    when /the body/\n      \"html &gt; body\"\n    else\n      raise \"Can't find mapping from \\\"#{scope}\\\" to a selector.\\n\" +\n        \"Now, go and add a mapping in #{__FILE__}\"\n    end\n  end\nend\n\nWorld(HtmlSelectorsHelper)\n\nApplying the Solution\nMy previous example of the flawed Cucumber scenario now becomes:\nWhen I fill in \"Username\" with \"bjeanes\" within the sign up form\nAnd I press \"Sign up!\" within the sign up form\nThen I should see \"You have successfully signed up\" within the notice flash\n\nAnd the selectors.rb case statement gets the following additions:\ncase\n  # ...\n\n  when /the sign up form/\n    \".main-panel form#signup-form\"\n  when /the (notice|error|info) flash/\n    \".flash.#{$1}\"\n\n  # ...\nend\n\nNotice how the scenario now identifies things on our page by their semantic identifiers, not by brittle CSS or XPath\nlocations which are prone to change. As a bonus, now if when they do change, the paths only need to be\nupdated in a single location in our Cucumber test suite!\nPatching Cucumber\nI feel pretty strongly that CSS and XPath don’t belong in our feature files because not only does it encourage brittle\ntests (as shown above), but also because those selectors are entirely irrelevant to end users, and that’s kind of the\nmain point of using a natural language DSL to describe our integration tests, i.e. putting on the user shoes.\nI’d really like to patch this back into Cucumber, and I entirely plan to do so, providing I get the time.\nI got the time, and here is my pull request to have it merged.\nExpanding the Solution\nYou’ll note my HtmlSelectorsHelper module only accommodates CSS selectors. That’s only because I have never needed\nXPath in this context. It’d be very simple to modify my examples to do so, though, with a combination of multiple return\nvalues and a splat. That’s an exercise for the reader (or me if I end up patching Cucumber).\nFinal Word\nI apologise for the length of this article, but I congratulate you for making it all the way through it!\nI now have so many blog post ideas lined up that I’ve had to create a new category in Things.app just to hold them all.\nThis means that I’ll be striving to get a few more posts done and out the door in the next few weeks, including a\nperformance comparison of different data encapsulations for web application APIs on the iPhone (i.e. is it better to use\nPlists, JSON, or XML?) and a post on why I think there should be 8 RESTful actions, not the 7 that Rails prescribes by\ndefault.\n","id":"https://bjeanes.com/posts/selector-free-cucumber-scenarios/","title":"Selector-Free Cucumber Scenarios"},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/talk-ssh-can-do-that/":{"body":"Last night I gave a talk on the darker side of SSH at ChiSC meetup group.\nHere's a video version for those who are interested (sorry about the poor audio quality):\n\n","id":"https://bjeanes.com/posts/talk-ssh-can-do-that/","title":"Talk: SSH Can Do That?"},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/unescaping-utf-8-strings-in-ruby-1-9/":{"body":"Today, Ryan Bigg and I encountered a little issue with String encodings in Ruby 1.9.

Because of the nature of the data we were\ndisplaying one level as columns and the other level as rows.\nUnfortunately, HTML mandates that we group everything by rows — each\ncolumn is really just a single cell. This means that we have to iterate\nover the “column” values not just once, but once for every row.\nNow, fields_for takes care of naming your\n&lt;input&gt; tags magically with the correct indexes so that\nyour models can accept the params directly and magic happens. However,\nevidently calling fields_for multiple times was not\npart of the original intention, and it seems resetting the index after\neach call was neglected.\n`chendo couldn't see a cleaner way of doing this so we added our own option to reset the index. We didn't just override the behaviour in case there is a good reason to leave it, but here is our code:\nclass ActionView::Helpers::FormBuilder\n  def fields_for_with_nested_attributes_with_index_reset(association_name, args, block)\n    if args.last.is_a?(Hash) &amp;&amp; args.last[:reset_index]\n      @nested_child_index = nil\n    end\n\n    fields_for_without_nested_attributes_without_index_reset(association_name, args, block)\n  end\n\n  alias_method_change :fields_for_with_nested_attributes, :index_reset\nend\n\n","id":"https://bjeanes.com/posts/using-fields-for-with-nested-attributes-calling-it-multiple-times/","title":"Using fields_for with Nested Attributes, Calling it Multiple Times"},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/using-fish-shells-event-system-to-behave-like-method-missing/":{"body":"Dr Nic’s latest post, hash bang\ncucumber, reminded\nme of a piece of hax I whipped up a few weeks ago with Ruby and Fish Shell.\nFish has an event system that allows you to register functions to be auto-run after or during certain events (such as\nwhen a particular environment variable is changed). One of this events is called fish_command_not_found. It is\ntriggered whenever you type a non-existant command into the prompt.\nWith this in mind, you can trigger certain commands to run by matching what fish couldn’t manage to run automatically by\ncatching this event.\nFor instance:\nfunction __fish_method_missing --on-event fish_command_not_found\n  method_missing $argv\nend\n\nfuncsave method_missing\n\nGiven that function is created (simply paste the whole code block into your Fish terminal), I can now create a command\ncalled method_missing (or whatever you call inside your __fish_method_missing) and place it somewhere in your\n$PATH — I like ~/.config/fish/bin.\nMy method_missing binary is simply something like this:\n#!/usr/bin/env ruby\n\ncommand = ARGV.shift\n\ndef run(cmd)\n  puts \"Running #{cmd.inspect} instead\"\n  system(cmd)\nend\n\ncase command\nwhen /^git(@|:\\/\\/).*\\.git$/\n  run(\"git clone #{command.inspect}\")\nwhen /^(?:ftp|https?):\\/\\/.+\\.t(?:ar\\.)?gz$/\n  run(\"curl #{command.inspect} | tar xzv\")\nelse\n  $stderr.puts \"No default action defined in #{__FILE__.inspect}\"\n  abort\nend\n\nEach command you want to register just becomes a new when\nstatement. For instance, to implement the functionality Dr Nic was\ntrying to achieve, I simply modify the case block as such:\ncase command\nwhen /^[a-z0-9_\\-\\/]+\\.feature(:\\d+)?$/\n  run(\"cucumber #{command}\")\n# ...\nend\n\nThe existing entries I have in my method_missing command will auto-clone the repository of a pasted Git URL and\ndownload and expand a URL for a tar file, respectively. Not too shabby, and dead easy to implement.\n","id":"https://bjeanes.com/posts/using-fish-shells-event-system-to-behave-like-method-missing/","title":"Using Fish shell's event system to behave like method_missing"},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/using-partial-layouts-to-dry-out-your-views/":{"body":"The other day we got some HTML from the designer of one of our clients to implement as the new UI for an app we are\nbuilding at work. Overall the HTML was good but implementing it started to feel like I was repeating myself.\nFor example, around all the apps form the client’s design had a rounded white box, the HTML of which went something like\nthis:\n&lt;div class=\"content-wht\"&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"content-wht-inside\"&gt;\n        &lt;fieldset&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"frow\"&gt;\n                &lt;label&gt;Currency:&lt;/label&gt;\n                &lt;select class=\"fs\"&gt;&lt;option&gt;EUR&lt;/option&gt;&lt;/select&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n\n            &lt;div class=\"frow frlast\"&gt;\n                &lt;label&gt;File:&lt;/label&gt;\n                &lt;input type=\"file\" name=\"\" /&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/fieldset&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=\"cround\" align=\"center\"&gt;\n    &lt;img src=\"/images/round-corners-bottom.gif\" alt=\"\" /&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\nIt’s a lot of div tags to have to repeat around every form that has this style. Luckily a nice feature of Rails\npartials can help out.  Create a shared partial file that will act as a layout like this:\n&lt;!-- app/views/shared/_fieldset.html.erb --&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"content-wht\"&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"content-wht-inside\"&gt;\n        &lt;fieldset&gt;\n            &lt;%= yield %&gt;\n        &lt;/fieldset&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=\"cround\" align=\"center\"&gt;\n    &lt;img src=\"/images/round-corners-bottom.gif\" alt=\"\" /&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\nThen in your views that need to have this white box, simply wrap your content in that layout like so:\n&lt;% render :layout =&gt; 'shared/fieldset' do %&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"frow\"&gt;\n      &lt;label&gt;Currency:&lt;/label&gt;\n      &lt;select class=\"fs\"&gt;&lt;option&gt;EUR&lt;/option&gt;&lt;/select&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n\n  &lt;div class=\"frow frlast\"&gt;\n      &lt;label&gt;File:&lt;/label&gt;\n      &lt;input type=\"file\" name=\"\" /&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;% end %&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- Or, if the inner content is already in a partial --&gt;\n\n&lt;%= render, :partial =&gt; 'form', :layout =&gt; 'shared/fieldset' %&gt;\n\n","id":"https://bjeanes.com/posts/using-partial-layouts-to-dry-out-your-views/","title":"Using partial layouts to DRY out your views"}},"docInfo":{"https://bjeanes.com/":{"body":1,"title":2},"https://bjeanes.com/about/":{"body":33,"title":0},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/automatically-refresh-staging-db/":{"body":680,"title":7},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/call-clojure-function-on-a-timer/":{"body":152,"title":4},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/colemak/":{"body":235,"title":1},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/deploy-directory-to-branch/":{"body":599,"title":4},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/factories-breed-complexity/":{"body":513,"title":3},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/fish-shell-version-of-git-ps1-function-that-is-bundled-with-git/":{"body":198,"title":7},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/fix-for-dynamic-pager-cannot-open-swap-directory-private-var-vm-in-os-x-possibly-just-snow-leopard/":{"body":199,"title":11},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/generating-sound-from-sine-waves-on-the-iphone/":{"body":619,"title":5},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/happier-as-a-hacker/":{"body":161,"title":2},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/hell-yes/":{"body":263,"title":2},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/how-to-prepare-your-mac-for-resale/":{"body":189,"title":3},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/iterative-html5-turning-a-comma-separated-list-into-a-semantic-list/":{"body":145,"title":8},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/makers-and-making/":{"body":206,"title":2},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/motivate-your-lazy-sequences/":{"body":453,"title":3},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/pure-evil/":{"body":391,"title":2},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/rubycocoa-and-keychain-access/":{"body":337,"title":3},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/selector-free-cucumber-scenarios/":{"body":439,"title":4},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/talk-ssh-can-do-that/":{"body":19,"title":2},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/unescaping-utf-8-strings-in-ruby-1-9/":{"body":98,"title":6},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/using-accepts-nested-attributes-for-when-the-child-object-validates-presence-of-parent/":{"body":169,"title":6},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/using-apache-as-a-basicauth-proxy-to-an-internal-resource/":{"body":145,"title":6},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/using-fields-for-can-generate-invalid-html/":{"body":256,"title":5},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/using-fields-for-with-nested-attributes-calling-it-multiple-times/":{"body":123,"title":7},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/using-fish-shells-event-system-to-behave-like-method-missing/":{"body":172,"title":7},"https://bjeanes.com/posts/using-partial-layouts-to-dry-out-your-views/":{"body":162,"title":6}},"length":28},"lang":"English"};
