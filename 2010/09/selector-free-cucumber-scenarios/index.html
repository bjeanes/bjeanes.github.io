<meta name="description" content="(a Serbo-Croation translation by Anja Skrbaa is available here) I’ve been using Cucumber since pretty much the first day I heard about it. I’ve worked on a lot of projects that have relied on it’s presence for reliable development. Therefore, I’ve put a lot of effort into perfecting my Cucumber infrastructure to make this fantastic tool even better. I’m going to share one such morsel of code that makes developing with Cucumber even greater. The Problem I’ve worked on a lot of web applications and, as I’m sure many of you know, quite often the development of a web application is focussed on the functionality foremost, and the interface and style is incorporated later. It may be that the client doesn’t yet know the feel they want for their project or that they want to focus their budget towards prototyping the application first. This is fine, except for the fact that changing the HTML and CSS of a web application after a lot of functionality has been developed is a fantastic way to break all your integration tests. This is particularly true if you have scenarios like the following contrived one: When I fill in &quot;Username&quot; with &quot;bjeanes&quot; within &quot;.main-panel form#signup-form&quot; And I press &quot;Sign up!&quot; within &quot;.main-panel form#signup-form&quot; Then I should see &quot;You have successfully signed up&quot; within &quot;.flash.notice&quot; The problem is, of course, that designers might change the HTML that used to be .main-panel form#signup-form into something sexier and more semantic. The Solution This problem is not unlike an already-solved one; we’ve all moved away from hardcoding URLs like “/users/new” into our views and Cucumber scenarios and replacing them with new_user_path and the signup page, respectively. So why not apply the same formula that paths.rb uses for removing URLs from scenarios to our situation with selectors? Here’s what I add to all new projects: # I&#39;m in features/step_definitions/web_ext_steps.rb When /^(.*) within ([^:&quot;]+)$/ do |step, scope| with_scope(selector_for(scope)) do When step end end # Multi-line version of above When /^(.*) within ([^:&quot;]+):$/ do |step, scope, table_or_string| with_scope(selector_for(scope)) do When &quot;#{step}:&quot;, table_or_string end end And: # I&#39;m in features/support/selectors.rb module HtmlSelectorsHelper def selector_for(scope) case scope when /the body/ &quot;html &gt; body&quot; else raise &quot;Can&#39;t find mapping from \&quot;#{scope}\&quot; to a selector.\n&quot; + &quot;Now, go and add a mapping in #{__FILE__}&quot; end end end World(HtmlSelectorsHelper) Applying the Solution My previous example of the flawed Cucumber scenario now becomes: When I fill in &quot;Username&quot; with &quot;bjeanes&quot; within the sign up form And I press &quot;Sign up!&quot; within the sign up form Then I should see &quot;You have successfully signed up&quot; within the notice flash And the selectors.rb case statement gets the following additions: case # ... when /the sign up form/ &quot;.main-panel form#signup-form&quot; when /the (notice|error|info) flash/ &quot;.flash.#{$1}&quot; # ... end Notice how the scenario now identifies things on our page by their semantic identifiers, not by brittle CSS or XPath locations which are prone to change. As a bonus, now if when they do change, the paths only need to be updated in a single location in our Cucumber test suite! Patching Cucumber I feel pretty strongly that CSS and XPath don’t belong in our feature files because not only does it encourage brittle tests (as shown above), but also because those selectors are entirely irrelevant to end users, and that’s kind of the main point of using a natural language DSL to describe our integration tests, i.e. putting on the user shoes. I’d really like to patch this back into Cucumber, and I entirely plan to do so, providing I get the time. &lt;/del&gt; I got the time, and here is my pull request to have it merged.

<p>I’ve been using Cucumber since pretty much the first day I heard about
it. I’ve worked on a lot of projects that have relied on it’s presence
for reliable development. Therefore, I’ve put a lot of effort into
perfecting my Cucumber infrastructure to make this fantastic tool even
better. I’m going to share one such morsel of code that makes developing
with Cucumber even greater.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>

<p>I’ve worked on a lot of web applications and, as I’m sure many of you
know, quite often the development of a web application is focussed on
the functionality foremost, and the interface and style is incorporated
later. It may be that the client doesn’t yet know the feel they want for
their project or that they want to focus their budget towards
prototyping the application first.</p>

<p>This is fine, except for the fact that changing the HTML and CSS of a
web application after a lot of functionality has been developed is a
fantastic way to break all your integration tests.</p>

<p>This is particularly true if you have scenarios like the following
contrived one:</p>

<div class="language-cucumber highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nf">When </span>I fill in <span class="s">"Username"</span> with <span class="s">"bjeanes"</span> within <span class="s">".main-panel form#signup-form"</span>
<span class="nf">And </span>I press <span class="s">"Sign up!"</span> within <span class="s">".main-panel form#signup-form"</span>
<span class="nf">Then </span>I should see <span class="s">"You have successfully signed up"</span> within <span class="s">".flash.notice"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The problem is, of course, that designers might change the HTML that
used to be <code class="highlighter-rouge">.main-panel form#signup-form</code> into something sexier and more
semantic.</p>

<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>

<p>This problem is not unlike an already-solved one; we’ve all moved away
from hardcoding URLs like “/users/new” into our views and Cucumber
scenarios and replacing them with <code class="highlighter-rouge">new_user_path</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">the signup page</code>,
respectively.</p>

<p>So why not apply the same formula that <code class="highlighter-rouge">paths.rb</code> uses for removing URLs
from scenarios to our situation with selectors?</p>

<p>Here’s what I add to all new projects:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># I'm in features/step_definitions/web_ext_steps.rb</span>

<span class="no">When</span> <span class="sr">/^(.*) within ([^:"]+)$/</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">step</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">scope</span><span class="o">|</span>
  <span class="n">with_scope</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">selector_for</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">scope</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="no">When</span> <span class="n">step</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="c1"># Multi-line version of above</span>
<span class="no">When</span> <span class="sr">/^(.*) within ([^:"]+):$/</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">step</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">scope</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">table_or_string</span><span class="o">|</span>
  <span class="n">with_scope</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">selector_for</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">scope</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="no">When</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">step</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">:"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">table_or_string</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>  
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># I'm in features/support/selectors.rb</span>

<span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">HtmlSelectorsHelper</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">selector_for</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">scope</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">case</span> <span class="n">scope</span>
    <span class="k">when</span> <span class="sr">/the body/</span>
      <span class="s2">"html &gt; body"</span>
    <span class="k">else</span>
      <span class="k">raise</span> <span class="s2">"Can't find mapping from </span><span class="se">\"</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">scope</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="se">\"</span><span class="s2"> to a selector.</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s2">"</span> <span class="o">+</span>
        <span class="s2">"Now, go and add a mapping in </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="kp">__FILE__</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="no">World</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">HtmlSelectorsHelper</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="applying-the-solution">Applying the Solution</h2>

<p>My previous example of the flawed Cucumber scenario now becomes:</p>

<div class="language-cucumber highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nf">When </span>I fill in <span class="s">"Username"</span> with <span class="s">"bjeanes"</span> within the sign up form
<span class="nf">And </span>I press <span class="s">"Sign up!"</span> within the sign up form
<span class="nf">Then </span>I should see <span class="s">"You have successfully signed up"</span> within the notice flash
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And the <code class="highlighter-rouge">selectors.rb</code> case statement gets the following additions:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">case</span>
  <span class="c1"># ...</span>
  
  <span class="k">when</span> <span class="sr">/the sign up form/</span>
    <span class="s2">".main-panel form#signup-form"</span>
  <span class="k">when</span> <span class="sr">/the (notice|error|info) flash/</span>
    <span class="s2">".flash.</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="vg">$1</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
  
  <span class="c1"># ...</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice how the scenario now identifies things on our page by their
semantic identifiers, not by brittle CSS or XPath locations which are
prone to change. As a bonus, now <del>if</del> when they do change, the paths only need to be updated in a single
location in our Cucumber test suite!</p>

<h2 id="patching-cucumber">Patching Cucumber</h2>

<p>I feel pretty strongly that CSS and XPath don’t belong in our feature
files because not only does it encourage brittle tests (as shown above),
but also because those selectors are entirely irrelevant to end users,
and that’s kind of the main point of using a natural language DSL to
describe our integration tests, i.e. putting on the user shoes.</p>

<p><del>
I’d really like to patch this back into Cucumber, and I entirely plan to
do so, providing I get the time.</del></p>

<p>&lt;/del&gt;
I got the time, and here is my <a href="http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber-rails/pull/63">pull
request</a> to have
it merged.</p>

<h2 id="expanding-the-solution">Expanding the Solution</h2>

<p>You’ll note my <code class="highlighter-rouge">HtmlSelectorsHelper</code> module only accommodates CSS
selectors. That’s only because I have never needed XPath in this
context. It’d be very simple to modify my examples to do so, though,
with a combination of multiple return values and a splat. That’s an
exercise for the reader (or me if I end up patching Cucumber).</p>

<h2 id="final-word">Final Word</h2>

<p>I apologise for the length of this article, but I congratulate you for
making it all the way through it!</p>

<p>I now have so many blog post ideas lined up that I’ve had to create a
new category in Things.app just to hold them all. This means that I’ll
be striving to get a few more posts done and out the door in the next
few weeks, including a performance comparison of different data
encapsulations for web application APIs on the iPhone (i.e. is it better
to use Plists, JSON, or XML?) and a post on why I think there should be
8 RESTful actions, not the 7 that Rails prescribes by default.</p>

    <div class="f6 f5-ns fw3 lh-copy silver">Bo is a software engineer who cares deeply about simplicity in design and
building complex behaviours out of simple primitives. Bo primarily works in
Ruby day-to-day, though is a functional programmer at heart and a fan of
programming languages generally, with particular soft spots for Clojure,
