        <h3 class="f3 fw6 lh-title mb0">Pausing Cucumber Scenarios to Debug</h3>
        <p class="f5 fw3 lh-copy mv2">Continuing what I started with my <a href="http://bjeanes.com/2010/09/19/selector-free-cucumber-scenarios">post last
light</a>,
I’ve got another tip for developing productively when using Cucumber.

I’m going to show you a simple way to pause cucumber stories in order to
investigate the current state of your application at that point.

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="no">AfterStep</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'@pause'</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="nb">print</span> <span class="s2">"Press Return to continue"</span>
  <span class="no">STDIN</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">getc</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

Then just tag any Cucumber feature or scenario with <code class="highlighter-rouge">@pause</code>. After the
first step is run, the scenario will stop running and you can do
whatever you like before proceeding.

My favourite tactic is to combine the <code class="highlighter-rouge">@pause</code> tag with <code class="highlighter-rouge">@selenium</code> tag
to have WebDriver stop driving FireFox for a moment and let me click
around in the application or inspect the HTML/CSS at that point.

My next post will be about enabling FireBug in the “WebDriver” profile
to help inspecting the web page when you’ve paused a scenario.

I’ve been using Cucumber since pretty much the first day I heard about
it. I’ve worked on a lot of projects that have relied on it’s presence
for reliable development. Therefore, I’ve put a lot of effort into
perfecting my Cucumber infrastructure to make this fantastic tool even
better. I’m going to share one such morsel of code that makes developing
with Cucumber even greater.

<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>

I’ve worked on a lot of web applications and, as I’m sure many of you
know, quite often the development of a web application is focussed on
the functionality foremost, and the interface and style is incorporated
later. It may be that the client doesn’t yet know the feel they want for
their project or that they want to focus their budget towards
prototyping the application first.

This is fine, except for the fact that changing the HTML and CSS of a
web application after a lot of functionality has been developed is a
fantastic way to break all your integration tests.

This is particularly true if you have scenarios like the following
contrived one:

<div class="language-cucumber highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nf">When </span>I fill in <span class="s">"Username"</span> with <span class="s">"bjeanes"</span> within <span class="s">".main-panel form#signup-form"</span>
<span class="nf">And </span>I press <span class="s">"Sign up!"</span> within <span class="s">".main-panel form#signup-form"</span>
<span class="nf">Then </span>I should see <span class="s">"You have successfully signed up"</span> within <span class="s">".flash.notice"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

The problem is, of course, that designers might change the HTML that
used to be <code class="highlighter-rouge">.main-panel form#signup-form</code> into something sexier and more
semantic.

<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>

This problem is not unlike an already-solved one; we’ve all moved away
from hardcoding URLs like “/users/new” into our views and Cucumber
scenarios and replacing them with <code class="highlighter-rouge">new_user_path</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">the signup page</code>,
respectively.

So why not apply the same formula that <code class="highlighter-rouge">paths.rb</code> uses for removing URLs
from scenarios to our situation with selectors?

Here’s what I add to all new projects:

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># I'm in features/step_definitions/web_ext_steps.rb</span>

<span class="no">When</span> <span class="sr">/^(.*) within ([^:"]+)$/</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">step</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">scope</span><span class="o">|</span>
  <span class="n">with_scope</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">selector_for</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">scope</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="no">When</span> <span class="n">step</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="c1"># Multi-line version of above</span>
<span class="no">When</span> <span class="sr">/^(.*) within ([^:"]+):$/</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">step</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">scope</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">table_or_string</span><span class="o">|</span>
  <span class="n">with_scope</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">selector_for</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">scope</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="no">When</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">step</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">:"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">table_or_string</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>  
</code></pre></div></div>

And:

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># I'm in features/support/selectors.rb</span>

<span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">HtmlSelectorsHelper</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">selector_for</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">scope</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">case</span> <span class="n">scope</span>
    <span class="k">when</span> <span class="sr">/the body/</span>
      <span class="s2">"html &gt; body"</span>
    <span class="k">else</span>
      <span class="k">raise</span> <span class="s2">"Can't find mapping from </span><span class="se">\"</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">scope</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="se">\"</span><span class="s2"> to a selector.</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s2">"</span> <span class="o">+</span>
        <span class="s2">"Now, go and add a mapping in </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="kp">__FILE__</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="no">World</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">HtmlSelectorsHelper</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="applying-the-solution">Applying the Solution</h2>

My previous example of the flawed Cucumber scenario now becomes:

<div class="language-cucumber highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nf">When </span>I fill in <span class="s">"Username"</span> with <span class="s">"bjeanes"</span> within the sign up form
<span class="nf">And </span>I press <span class="s">"Sign up!"</span> within the sign up form
<span class="nf">Then </span>I should see <span class="s">"You have successfully signed up"</span> within the notice flash
</code></pre></div></div>

And the <code class="highlighter-rouge">selectors.rb</code> case statement gets the following additions:

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">case</span>
  <span class="c1"># ...</span>
  
  <span class="k">when</span> <span class="sr">/the sign up form/</span>
    <span class="s2">".main-panel form#signup-form"</span>
  <span class="k">when</span> <span class="sr">/the (notice|error|info) flash/</span>
    <span class="s2">".flash.</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="vg">$1</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
  
  <span class="c1"># ...</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

Notice how the scenario now identifies things on our page by their
semantic identifiers, not by brittle CSS or XPath locations which are
prone to change. As a bonus, now <del>if</del> when they do change, the paths only need to be updated in a single
location in our Cucumber test suite!

<h2 id="patching-cucumber">Patching Cucumber</h2>

I feel pretty strongly that CSS and XPath don’t belong in our feature
files because not only does it encourage brittle tests (as shown above),
but also because those selectors are entirely irrelevant to end users,
and that’s kind of the main point of using a natural language DSL to
describe our integration tests, i.e. putting on the user shoes.

<del>
I’d really like to patch this back into Cucumber, and I entirely plan to
do so, providing I get the time.</del>

&lt;/del&gt;
I got the time, and here is my <a href="http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber-rails/pull/63">pull
request</a> to have
it merged.

<h2 id="expanding-the-solution">Expanding the Solution</h2>

You’ll note my <code class="highlighter-rouge">HtmlSelectorsHelper</code> module only accommodates CSS
selectors. That’s only because I have never needed XPath in this
context. It’d be very simple to modify my examples to do so, though,
with a combination of multiple return values and a splat. That’s an
exercise for the reader (or me if I end up patching Cucumber).

<h2 id="final-word">Final Word</h2>

I apologise for the length of this article, but I congratulate you for
making it all the way through it!

I now have so many blog post ideas lined up that I’ve had to create a
new category in Things.app just to hold them all. This means that I’ll
be striving to get a few more posts done and out the door in the next
few weeks, including a performance comparison of different data
encapsulations for web application APIs on the iPhone (i.e. is it better
to use Plists, JSON, or XML?) and a post on why I think there should be
8 RESTful actions, not the 7 that Rails prescribes by default.

        <p class="f5 fw3 lh-copy mv2"><h2 id="mocra">Mocra</h2>

Two weeks ago, Dr Nic informed me, and my coworkers, that <a href="http://drnicwilliams.com/2010/08/04/coming-to-america/">he had
accepted a job with
EngineYard</a> and
was moving to San Francisco within the month. Unfortunately, a
consequence of Nic’s wonderful opportunity is that he had to fire us all
and shutdown Mocra.

Of course, he broke the news to us in a more humane way, and even
encouraged me to take on the Mocra name and start a new company to
continue on without him. I haven’t ruled it out yet, but I am taking
this change as an opportunity to consider moving on in my career and
having some new experiences with fresh and inspiring people.

Over the last two years at Mocra, I’ve helped run the business, managed
the clients, and written awesome code, as well as worked on a slew of
<a href="http://github.com/bjeanes">open source contributions and projects</a>,
such as <a href="http://github.com/bjeanes/ghost">ghost</a>.

<h2 id="possibilities">Possibilities</h2>

A few opportunities and offers have presented themselves already, even
without having put myself out there, as I’m now trying. Some of them
have been quite tempting, and I’ve been exploring them, but some have
been less so.

After reading <a href="http://sivers.org/hellyeah">No more yes. It’s either HELL YEAH! or
no</a>, I’ve decided that I want to try to find
a job that’s will make me say “HELL
YEAH!” and go for it.

If you have a position or an endeavour that you think I might be right
for, please get in contact; I’d love to have a chat about the company,
idea, or your processes, and how we might be able to help each other.

I am looking for work starting from the beginning of September. My
long-term goal is to move out of Brisbane, so relocating is an option
I’d enthusiastically pursue. For a number of reasons, however, I’m tied
to Brisbane until about the end of the year.

Therefore, I’d love to find a company that can accommodate me as a
contractor for the few months until my partner and I are in a position
to move out of Brisbane, at which point I’d be eager to come on as a
full-timer. I am more than happy to come work on-site out of Brisbane
before the New Year for small stints, though.

If you want to know more, I’ll be making my
<a href="http://bjeanes.com/pages/about">About</a> page more relevant to my skills,
experiences, and interests over the next day or so. In the mean time,
feel free to <a href="me@bjeanes.com">email me</a> or call me on

        <p class="f5 fw3 lh-copy mv2">I recently was setting up a new VPS on Linode and I got the following
error when trying to create a new database:

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ERROR: new encoding is incompatible with the encoding of the template database
HINT: Use the same encoding as in the template database, or use template0 as template.
</code></pre></div></div>

This error is related to the locale of the system when Postgres was
installed. If you run the commands in my <a href="/2010/07/08/fix-locale-errors-on-linux">previous
post</a> before installing
Postgres, you should avoid these errors altogether.

If Postgres has already been installed, however, you can run the
following commands (assuming Postgres version 8.4) to reinitialise the
database with the correct encoding:

<div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="go">pg_dropcluster --stop 8.4 main
pg_createcluster --start -e UTF-8 8.4 main
</span></code></pre></div></div>

Note: this will erase all databases and reset your postgres
configuration so it is only really useful when you are first setting up
your database, or have taken appropriate measures to be able to restore
your data.

        <p class="f5 fw3 lh-copy mv2">Throughout Mac OS X, almost every input field and text area have
consistent keyboard shortcuts to navigate and edit the text. However, in
both Terminal and iTerm, some of these don’t work like you might be used
to. Furthermore, both iTerm and Terminal respond differently to each
other, as well as to hour the rest of the system does it.

Three shortcuts I’ve especially missed are: Option-Left to move left one
word, Option-Right to move right one word, and Option-Backspace to
delete one word to the left.

The ideal solution to get these working as I’d like would be to
configure an <code class="highlighter-rouge">inputrc</code> file. However, after playing around for a few
hours, I still couldn’t get this working reliably using the Option key.
So, my fallback is to configure the terminal apps to do this themselves.

If you set up the terminal applications to use Option as the Meta key,
some remote systems will already work with the keyboard shortcuts I
want. However, locally only the Option-Backspace one works and even then
it only works out of the box in Terminal.

So, here’s how to get all three working in both Terminal and iTerm,
locally and on remote systems:

<h2 id="terminal">Terminal</h2>

First, enable Option as meta key option by going to the *Preferences &gt;
Settings &gt; Your Profile &gt; Keyboard( and checking “Use option as meta
key” check box. This will get Option-Backspace working.

Next, while still in the Keyboard settings from the last step, press the
<ul>
  <li>button. In the popup, choose “cursor left” for the Key, “option” for
the Modifier, and “send string to shell:” for the Action. In the text
field, type Esc then lowercase B key and press OK. This will get the
Option-Left shortcut working.</li>
</ul>

To enable the Option-Right shortcut, repeat the previous step, instead
choosing “cursor right” for the Key, and typing Esc then lowercase F in
the text field.

If you switch Terminal themes, you will have to repeat these steps for
the new theme.

<h2 id="iterm">iTerm</h2>

For the iTerm configuration, I will simply point you to <a href="http://greyworld.net/en/blog/iterm-word-shortcuts/">this excellent
article</a> which help
me get up and running. The sections that correspond to the shortcuts I
set up are 2.1, 2.2, and 2.4.

        <p class="f5 fw3 lh-copy mv2">When writing new Cucumber scenarios, developers will usually start with
a failing scenario, incrementally making it pass, step by step. If this
is a common workflow for you, you’ll probably have noticed a trend of
having to re-run it each time a new step is failing, adding something
like <code class="highlighter-rouge">Then show me the page</code> after the last
passing step to see why the story is currently failing.

<a href="http://chendo.net">Chendo</a> and I came up with a nifty little solution
in just a few lines that really helps this process of seeing what webrat
sees when a scenario fails. Throw this snippet of code in a file in your
<code class="highlighter-rouge">features/support/</code> directory:

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="no">After</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">scenario</span><span class="o">|</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">scenario</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">respond_to?</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="n">scenario</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">status</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="ss">:failed</span>
    <span class="n">save_and_open_page</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
