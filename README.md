## Deploying

This site is hosted on GitHub pages but is not built by GitHub pages (due to the use of [`jekyll-archives`
plugin](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-archives)). However, the deployment experience is equivalent; simply commit
source changes and push to GitHub or edit in-line in GitHub UI.

A CI job will generate the site and push just the built site files to the appropriate branch for GitHub to serve.

For more details on how this works, see [this post](https://bjeanes.com/deploy-directory-to-branch/) on the
blog.
