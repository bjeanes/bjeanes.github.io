<meta name="description" content="I came across an interesting dilemma today in Rails 2.3 whilst trying to use accepts_nested_attributes_for. The models I have were: class Organization &lt; ActiveRecord::Base has_many :users accepts_nested_attributes_for :users end class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base belongs_to :organization validates_presence_of :organization end I had an “Organization” creation form which allowed an administrator to create an Organization and an initial user for it. However, even though I had filled in all the required fields to pass the validations I was constantly getting the following error: Organization can not be blank. Digging deeper I found that when an object is added to an association via the association.build method, the parent object isn’t actually set: &gt;&gt; o = Organization.new(:name =&gt; &quot;Test&quot;) =&gt; #&lt;Organization id: nil, name: &quot;Test&quot;&gt; &gt;&gt; u = o.users.build(:name =&gt; &quot;Test User&quot;) =&gt; #&lt;User id: nil, organization_id: nil, name: &quot;Test User&quot;&gt; &gt;&gt; u.organization =&gt; nil Apparently this flaw also applies to accepts_nested_attributes_for. When I send through the User params through from my form normally with the Organization params, it creates the User object in the users association as you’d expect, but raises a validation error because the User instance doesn’t recognise that it is has a parent Organization My quick 5 minute fix was to modify the Organization model thusly: class Organization &lt; ActiveRecord::Base has_many :users accepts_nested_attributes_for :users def users_attributes_with_self_assignment=(attributes) self.users_attributes_without_self_assignment = attributes users.each { |u| u.organization = self } end alias_method_chain :users_attributes=, :self_assignment end Related Rails bugs seem to be here and here. This patch will also solve the problem and is currently in edge, but didn’t make it in time for Rails 2.3." />

    <div class="mw7 w-100 f5 f4-ns fw3 lh-copy mb0">
    <p>I came across an interesting dilemma today in Rails 2.3 whilst trying to
use <code class="highlighter-rouge">accepts_nested_attributes_for</code>.</p>

<p>The models I have were:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Organization</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ActiveRecord</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Base</span>
  <span class="n">has_many</span> <span class="ss">:users</span>
  <span class="n">accepts_nested_attributes_for</span> <span class="ss">:users</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">User</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ActiveRecord</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Base</span>
  <span class="n">belongs_to</span> <span class="ss">:organization</span>
  <span class="n">validates_presence_of</span> <span class="ss">:organization</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I had an “Organization” creation form which allowed an administrator to
create an Organization and an initial user for it. However, even though
I had filled in all the required fields to pass the validations I was
constantly getting the following error: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Organization can not be blank</code>.</p>

<p>Digging deeper I found that when an object is added to an association
via the <code class="highlighter-rouge">association.build</code> method, the parent object
isn’t actually set:</p>

<div class="language-irb highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="go">&gt;&gt; o = Organization.new(:name =&gt; "Test")
</span><span class="p">=&gt;</span> <span class="kt">#&lt;</span><span class="no">Organization</span> <span class="ss">id: </span><span class="kp">nil</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">name: </span><span class="s2">"Test"</span><span class="kt">&gt;</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">u</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">o</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">users</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">build</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:name</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"Test User"</span><span class="p">)</span>  
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kt">#&lt;</span><span class="no">User</span> <span class="ss">id: </span><span class="kp">nil</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">organization_id: </span><span class="kp">nil</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">name: </span><span class="s2">"Test User"</span><span class="kt">&gt;</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">u</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">organization</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kp">nil</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Apparently this flaw also applies to
<code class="highlighter-rouge">accepts_nested_attributes_for</code>. When I send through the
User <code class="highlighter-rouge">params</code> through from my form normally with the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Organization</code> params, it creates the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">User</code> object in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">users</code> association
as you’d expect, but raises a validation error because the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">User</code> instance doesn’t recognise that it is has a parent
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Organization</code></p>

<p>My quick 5 minute fix was to modify the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Organization</code>
model thusly:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Organization</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ActiveRecord</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Base</span>
  <span class="n">has_many</span> <span class="ss">:users</span>
  <span class="n">accepts_nested_attributes_for</span> <span class="ss">:users</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">users_attributes_with_self_assignment</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">attributes</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="nb">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">users_attributes_without_self_assignment</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">attributes</span>
    <span class="n">users</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">each</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">u</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">u</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">organization</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">self</span> <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
  <span class="n">alias_method_chain</span> <span class="ss">:users_attributes</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:self_assignment</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

    <div class="f6 f5-ns fw3 lh-copy silver">Bo is a software engineer who cares deeply about simplicity in design and
building complex behaviours out of simple primitives. Bo primarily works in
Ruby day-to-day, though is a functional programmer at heart and a fan of
programming languages generally, with particular soft spots for Clojure,
Elixir, and Rust.
