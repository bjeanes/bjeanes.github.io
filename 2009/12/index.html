        <h3 class="f3 fw6 lh-title mb0">Australia&#39;s Mandatory Internet Filter</h3>
        <p class="f5 fw3 lh-copy mv2">I apologise to those who are uninterested for the rant that follows:

I can not stand nor hardly believe that the current government of my
otherwise awesome country would choose to completely ignore the advice
and expertise of industry professionals and the interests of the voters.

Today Steven Conroy, the Australian Minister of Communications, managed
to get a piece of legislation <del>passed</del> introduced that will require
all Australian ISPs to participate in the mandatory filtering of content
delivered to Australian citizen. Welcome to the likes of Iran and China.

The legislation has been disguised as a measure to protect children from
porn and the likes, despite repeated advice from industry professionals
that it will do little to curb illegal content, cost the tax payers
millions of dollars and ultimately make legal browsing a slower and
inferior experience than it already is.

Furthermore, the government has made a effort to <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2009/03/17/1237054787635.html?page=fullpage">actively
suppress</a>
the contents of the block list, keeping those affected (read: everyone)
completely in the dark at to how it will affect their experience. The
block list was leaked and shown to include content about which the
government should have no say in how or why it is viewed such as some
youtube videos, topics on Euthanasia, a gay dating site, flash and
downloadable games, and sexual education material (contraceptives, etc).

To the Rudd government:

This is not good enough. I am a voter and a tax payer and I will not
stand for this. I will actively participate in removing this ridiculous
action and I will march the streets to show my support for an
unrestricted flow of information like the rest of the world will
continue to enjoy. I will show other tax payers how you have wasted $40
million (or more) of their money on a piece of technology no one wants
and that will not work and remind them that this is done in a time of
financial uncertainty instead of focusing on real issues like our carbon
footprint as a nation. I have the knowledge and the will to undermine
this pointless act, and I will use them to do so.
