    <p>There have been a few posts asking how to access and manipulate the
Keychain from within RubyCocoa but no answers supplied. As someone who
is just getting into RubyCocoa (and Cocoa all together for that matter),
I thought I’d document once and for all the process I took to get it
working.</p>

<p>I am running on Leopard and while 10.5 is supposed to ship with
BridgeSupport for most frameworks, the Security framework must have been
left out. After playing around with using other frameworks (such as the
AddressBook framework) and seeing how they were used, I did a bit of
digging in the Apple Developer Documentation (incredible resource for
anyone starting out) and stumbled across this gem: <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/RubyPythonCocoa/Articles/GenerateFrameworkMetadata.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40005426">Generate Framework
Metadata</a></p>

<p>After reading this, I was accessing the keychain within 5 minutes.
Here’s how:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Run the following commands (first one will take some time):</p>

    <div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="go">gen_bridge_metadata -f Security -o Security.bridgesupport
mkdir -p /Library/BridgeSupport
mv Security.bridgesupport /Library/BridgeSupport
</span></code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Open an IRB session to test it:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<div class="language-irb highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="go">&gt;&gt; require 'osx/cocoa'
</span><span class="p">=&gt;</span> <span class="kp">true</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="no">OSX</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">require_framework</span> <span class="s1">'Security'</span>
<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kp">true</span>

<span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"method"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Hoorah! Two steps! Well, one because the second one was just testing…
Now go make password-able RubyCocoa application! I am not sure how to
pull this off with deployable apps but I suggest your apps could ship
with the file or run those commands on first-run or if the
Security.bridgesupport file doesn’t exist. Note: I have not tested
either of those scenarios, but I would guess the latter would be more
reliable for cross-version development (i.e. Tiger + Leopard)</p>

<p>been getting (myself included)</p>

<p>There is good news for anyone that has been getting the following error:</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>undefined local variable or method `trans’ for &lt;UNDEFINED&gt; … &lt;/&gt;:REXML::Document
Usage: gen_bridge_metadata [options] &lt;headers…&gt;

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There is a very simple fix. This is caused by a typo in the source of
REXML. It’s such a massive bug I can’t believe it made it into the
release of Ruby but i did some poking around and it looks like they
renamed a method and didn’t change all references to it.</p>

<p>There are two ways to fix it—patching REXML; and patching <code class="highlighter-rouge">gen_bridge_metadata</code>.</p>

<p>Personally I prefer patching the generator for peace of mind and have submitted the patch at
<a href="http://bridgesupport.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/1">http://bridgesupport.macosforge.org/trac/ticket/1</a>,
but I’ll show both fixes.</p>

    <div class="f6 f5-ns fw3 lh-copy silver">Bo is a software engineer who cares deeply about simplicity in design and
building complex behaviours out of simple primitives. Bo primarily works in
Ruby day-to-day, though is a functional programmer at heart and a fan of
programming languages generally, with particular soft spots for Clojure,
Elixir, and Rust.
