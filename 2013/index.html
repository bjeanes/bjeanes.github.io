Turning thought into reality quickly is what drew me to programming when I was young. There is such a raw and incomparable power that you get when making things with code and with perfectly suited software tools.

<h2 id="makers">Makers</h2>

A master cabinet maker can build the most ornate and beautiful cabinet with the simplest tools but it takes a long time and mistakes are costly. When mistakes are costly and the creative process is extensive, the cabinet maker’s ability to experiment and grow is hindered, and the quality can suffer as a result. With better tools, (s)he can be more productive, experiment with new designs through prototyping, and improve their craft.

<h2 id="making-for-makers">Making for Makers</h2>

I am a tool maker.

I’ve known this for some time now. My deepest satisfaction in my work has come from making someone else’s job easier, more productive, and, most importantly, more enjoyable.

The master cabinet maker is arguably adding value to the world, no matter their productivity. However, as a tool maker, one has the ability to have a multiplicative effect on the world. By making tools for other makers the effect is arguably exponential.

I want to help all makers experiment, grow, and, ultimately, make the world better.

Building great tools is quickly becoming my <a href="https://vimeo.com/36579366">guiding principle</a>. I plan to do this by remembering that <a href="http://www.pechakucha.org/channels/table-xi/presentations/the-most-valuable-skill">feedback is the most valuable skill</a> to learning, growing, and making and incorporating this concept into the tools that I build. Great tools provide actionable and specific feedback quickly and directly.

<h2 id="heroku-makes-for-makers">Heroku Makes for Makers</h2>

Next Monday will be my first day at <a href="https://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a>. I’ve used Heroku in some form or another since it was <a href="https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2009/1/12/whats_up_at_heroku">an online code editor for Rails</a>.

The moment I knew I was going to join Heroku was when I was allowed to sit in on one of their all hands, where I heard <a href="https://twitter.com/teich">Oren Teich</a> talk about Heroku’s guiding principle. More or less, he articulated my own guiding principle of helping makers.

I couldn’t be more excited to start.

        <h3 class="f3 fw6 lh-title mb0">Two months without Twitter</h3>
        <p class="f5 fw3 lh-copy mv2">Two months ago, frustrated with inability to focus on the things I cared about in life and at work, I formed a theory:

<blockquote>
  Twitter (et al.) has slowly been rewiring my brain to encourage rapid context switching.
</blockquote>

On average, it probably takes less than a second to read and process a tweet. There are often hundreds of new tweets between “hits,” which means that during vulnerable times of the day (e.g. in bed before sleep), <strong>my brain is rapidly context switching hundreds of times in a matter of minutes</strong>.

For me, Twitter has always been about consuming information and learning. Despite the fear of “missing out” on interesting links or thoughts in my network[1], which is predominantly made of people I respect and trust, <strong>I decided that this rapid and varied consumption is not a healthy way to achieve this goal</strong>.

It’s been two months since I uninstalled all Twitter (and Facebook) applications from all my devices. I still tweet occasionally (using iOS/Mac’s Notification Center), but I make a point not to check the Twitter feed. <strong>I re-enabled email notifications</strong> for mentions and only log in to the web interface to reply to mentions/messages.

I love it. I want this to stick.

<small>[1] <a href="http://getprismatic.com">Prismatic</a> is a pretty great way of countering this. It usually cuts through the noise and gives me meal-sized versions of the best content, instead of bite-sized versions of irrelevancy.</small>

        <h3 class="f3 fw6 lh-title mb0">A collaborative thought experiment on company environment, values, culture, and ethos</h3>
        <p class="f5 fw3 lh-copy mv2"><strong>TL;DR</strong>: add your thoughts/experience on company values and culture to <a href="https://github.com/bjeanes/culture">this repo</a>.

Lately, I have been thinking a lot about the types of working environments and how they impact the productivity and happiness of the people who work in them.

After many discussions on and research into the topics of leadership, management, and company culture, I felt like I had to start taking notes of how everything pieced together. Specifically, I wanted to write down what the culture and environment look like of a company that I would love to work at and/or start.

Being a developer and contributor to open source software, it seemed clear to me that something like this could benefit immensely from a collaborative and open approach.

And so, <a href="https://github.com/bjeanes/culture">here</a> is the ever-evolving work and distillation of this process.

I’d love for people to contribute their input in the form of pull requests and discussions. And, where more appropriate, people or companies could fork the still-not-aptly-titled work to form the basis of a different set of values.

If I were to start a company right now, a living document like this would be available for all employees to see, discuss, dispute, and change.

        <h3 class="f3 fw6 lh-title mb0">Critiquing Leadership (Part 1 of N on Leadership)</h3>
        <p class="f5 fw3 lh-copy mv2"><small>This is part 1 of some unknown number of thoughts and essays on leadership. Your thoughts are welcomed in the comments.</small>

If leaders (or managers, as it were) are not constantly soliciting critique from their followers, their harshest critics won’t feel safe being honest or speaking up at all.

This can create a bubble of false perception, by such leaders, that they are doing well. Instead of hearing the honest criticism (which, of course, still exists), it will spread laterally behind closed doors and manifest in alienation, resentment, and/or apathy.

This can only perpetuate the problem.

If you are a leader and you are not being openly critized by those you purport to lead, that is a warning sign. Note that, like all humans everywhere, you are not perfect; a lack of criticism is therefore a sign of something other than your successes. Likely, it’s a sign that you do not have a healthy relationship with your followers (or employees).

Do not wait for criticism — seek it out. Do not form a bubble of complacency that limits your perception of reality and your ability to handle the inevitable, your loss of followers (or employees).
