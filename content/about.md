Bo is a software engineer who cares deeply about simplicity in design and building complex behaviours out of simple
primitives. Bo primarily works in Ruby day-to-day, though is a functional programmer at heart and a fan of programming
languages generally, with particular soft spots for Rust, Elixir, and Clojure.
