<small>This is part 1 of some unknown number of thoughts and essays on leadership. Your thoughts are welcomed in the comments.</small>

If leaders (or managers, as it were) are not constantly soliciting critique from their followers, their harshest critics won’t feel safe being honest or speaking up at all. 

This can create a bubble of false perception, by such leaders, that they are doing well. Instead of hearing the honest criticism (which, of course, still exists), it will spread laterally behind closed doors and manifest in alienation, resentment, and/or apathy. 

This can only perpetuate the problem.

If you are a leader and you are not being openly critized by those you purport to lead, that is a warning sign. Note that, like all humans everywhere, you are not perfect; a lack of criticism is therefore a sign of something other than your successes. Likely, it’s a sign that you do not have a healthy relationship with your followers (or employees).

Do not wait for criticism — seek it out. Do not form a bubble of complacency that limits your perception of reality and your ability to handle the inevitable, your loss of followers (or employees).
