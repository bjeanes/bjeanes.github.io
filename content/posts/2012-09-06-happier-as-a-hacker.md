I’ve grown a lot in the last few years, personally and, specifically, in my career. My values have changed and it’s affected the way I think and work.

There has been a gradual progression towards caring more and more about the Right Way™ to do things. For example, more than ever before, I value simplicity and clarity over ease and cleverness (an epidemic that greatly afflicts the Ruby community, in my opinion).

But, these values have come at a cost to me. Somewhere along the way, I complacently let *getting it right* become far more important than *getting it done*.” Don’t get me wrong, getting things right is very important — where I went wrong was valuing getting it right the **first** time. 

It may not plague others to the extent that it has me, but this misplaced obsession has gotten in the way of progress. It’s caused a type of analysis paralysis not unlike writers’ block; I discard ideas and directions too early because they aren’t “good enough.” But exploring a potentially bad direction is still being better than having no direction — which is the only place you end up when you discard ideas before they have a chance to blossom.

In the eternal words of [Little Red Ridinghood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Into_the_Woods):

> Isn't it nice to know a lot?  
> And a little bit not.

I was happier as a hacker, blissfully ignorant as I was, because I got things done. 

It’s time to become a hacker again; it’s time to be creative and explorative, and work towards *approximating* the Right Way™, iteratively. Truly, this is one of the great realizations of Agile — focus on progress instead of planning and pre-empting every possible outcome.

I can’t forget that.
