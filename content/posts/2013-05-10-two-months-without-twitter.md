Two months ago, frustrated with inability to focus on the things I cared about in life and at work, I formed a theory:

> Twitter (et al.) has slowly been rewiring my brain to encourage rapid context switching. 

On average, it probably takes less than a second to read and process a tweet. There are often hundreds of new tweets between "hits," which means that during vulnerable times of the day (e.g. in bed before sleep), **my brain is rapidly context switching hundreds of times in a matter of minutes**.

For me, Twitter has always been about consuming information and learning. Despite the fear of "missing out" on interesting links or thoughts in my network[1], which is predominantly made of people I respect and trust, **I decided that this rapid and varied consumption is not a healthy way to achieve this goal**.

It's been two months since I uninstalled all Twitter (and Facebook) applications from all my devices. I still tweet occasionally (using iOS/Mac's Notification Center), but I make a point not to check the Twitter feed. **I re-enabled email notifications** for mentions and only log in to the web interface to reply to mentions/messages.

I love it. I want this to stick.
