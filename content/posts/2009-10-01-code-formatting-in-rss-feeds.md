Apologies readers â€” I just realised that the code formatting is kinda
screwed up in RSS feeds because I am using some HTML5 elements to
represent my code blocks and using CSS to style them appropriately on
the site. The RSS feeds obviously lack these stylesheets and so look
pretty crap. I am not sure what the best solution is yet. Perhaps I
embed a `<style>` in each RSS post or simply have the RSS feeds
only show an excerpt of the full post.

Any ideas?
